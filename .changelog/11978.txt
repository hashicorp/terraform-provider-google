```release-note:bug
container: `node_config.linux_config`, `node_config.workload_metadata_config` and `node_config.kubelet_config` will now successfully send empty messages to the API when `terraform plan` indicates they are being removed, rather than null, which caused an error. The sole reliable case is `node_config.linux_config` when the block is removed, where there will still be a permadiff, but the update request that's triggered will no longer error and other changes displayed in the plan should go through.
