```release-note:enhancement
container: Added support for concurrent node pool mutations on a cluster. Previously, node pool mutations were restricted to run synchronously clientside. NOTE: While this feature is supported in Terraform from this release onwards, only a limited number of GCP projects will support this behavior initially. The provider will automatically process mutations concurrently as the feature rolls out generally.
