```release-note:bug
container: fixed the `ROUTES` value for the `networking_mode` field in `google_container_cluster`. A recent API change unintentionally changed the default to a `VPC_NATIVE` cluster, and removed the ability to create a `ROUTES`-based one. Provider versions prior to this one will default to `VPC_NATIVE` due to this change, and are unable to create `ROUTES` clusters.
