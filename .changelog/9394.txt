```release-note:bug
provider: made `terraform_labels` immutable in immutable resources to not block the upgrade. This will create a Terraform plan that recreates the resource on `4.X` -> `5.6.0` upgrade for affected resources. A mitigation to backfill the values during the upgrade is planned, and will release resource-by-resource.
