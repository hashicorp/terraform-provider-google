```release-note:bug
cloudrun: fixed a bug where changing the non-updatable `location` of a `google_cloud_run_service` would not force resource recreation
```
```release-note:breaking-change
cloudrun: changed the `location` of `google_cloud_run_service` so that modifying the `location` field will recreate the resource rather than causing Terraform to report it would attempt an invalid update 
```
