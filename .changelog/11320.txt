```release-note:breaking-change
container: three label-related fields are now in `google_container_cluster` resource. `resource_labels` field is non-authoritative and only manages the labels defined by the users on the resource through Terraform. The new output-only `terraform_labels` field merges the labels defined by the users on the resource through Terraform and the default labels configured on the provider. The new output-only `effective_labels` field lists all of labels present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients.
```
```release-note:breaking-change

All three fields will have all of labels present on the resource in GCP including the labels configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients, equivalent to `effective_labels` on the resource.
