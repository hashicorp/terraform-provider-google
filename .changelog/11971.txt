```release-note:bug
container: fixed a diff triggered by a new API-side default value for `node_config.0.kubelet_config.0.insecure_kubelet_readonly_port_enabled`. Terraform will now accept server-specified values for `node_config.0.kubelet_config` when it is not defined in configuration and will not detect drift. Note that this means that removing the value from configuration will now preserve old settings instead of reverting the old settings.
