Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

-/+ resource "google_compute_organization_security_policy" "c_org_sec_policy_24412" {
