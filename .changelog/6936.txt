```release-note:note
sql: fixed an issue where `google_sql_database` was abandoned by default as of version `4.45.0`. Users who have upgraded to `4.45.0` or `4.46.0` will see a diff when running their next `terraform apply` after upgrading this version, indicating the `deletion_policy` field's value has changed from `"ABANDON"` to `"DELETE"`. This will create a no-op call against the API, but can otherwise be safely applied.
