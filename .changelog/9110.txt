container: removed `enable_binary_authorization` in `google_container_cluster`

container: removed the behaviour that `google_container_cluster` will delete the cluster if it's created in an error state. Instead, it will mark the cluster as tainted, allowing manual inspection and intervention. To proceed with deletion, run another `terraform apply`.
```
```release-note:bug
compute: removed the default value for field `reconcile_connections ` in resource `google_compute_service_attachment`, the field will now default to a value returned by the API when not set in configuration

```
```release-note:breaking-change
container: reworked the `taint` field in `google_container_cluster` and `google_container_node_pool` to only manage a subset of taint keys based on those already in state. Most existing resources are unaffected, unless they use `sandbox_config`- see upgrade guide for details.
```
```release-note:enhancement
container: added the `effective_taints` attribute to `google_container_cluster` and `google_container_node_pool`, outputting all known taint values

```release-note:enhancement
baremetal: make delete a noop for the resource `google_bare_metal_admin_cluster` to better align with actual behavior
```
```release-note:breaking-change

```
```release-note:breaking-change
monitoring: fixed perma-diffs in `google_monitoring_dashboard.dashboard_json` by suppressing values returned by the API that are not in configuration
```
