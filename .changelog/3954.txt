```release-note:note
Added `deletion_protection` to `google_sql_database_instance`, which defaults to true. SQL instances can no longer be destroyed without setting `deletion_protection = false`.
```
```release-note:enhancement
sql: added a check to `google_sql_database_instance` to catch failures early by seeing if Service Networking Connections already exists for the private network of the instance.
```
