```release-note:enhancement
discoveryengine: added `connector_modes`, `sync_mode`, `incremental_refresh_interval`, `auto_run_disabled`, and `incremental_sync_disabled` fields to `google_discovery_engine_data_connector` resource
```

```release-note:enhancement
discoveryengine: added `kms_key_name` field to `google_discovery_engine_search_engine` resource
```

```release-note:bug
discoveryengine: fixed bug where it wasn't possible to specify values for `knowledgeBaseSysId` or `catalogSysId` in `google_discovery_engine_data_connector.entities.params`.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
discoveryengine: changed type of `google_discovery_engine_data_connector.entities.params`. Previously, it was a map of string keys to string values; now, it must be a [JSON-encoded](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode) string containing an object. This change is being made in a minor release because the field wasn't usable as intended â€“ specifically, all current valid uses require mapping strings to _lists_ of strings.
