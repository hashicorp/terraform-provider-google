```release-note:enhancement
Volume deletions fail if a volume contains nested resources (= snapshot). Such volumes require a force delete.
Adds a new parameter called `deletion_policy`. The user can set it to
- `DEFAULT`: The default behavior is to still fail volume delete if nested resources exist.
- `FORCE`: Force volume deletion, meaning nested resources will be deleted as well.
