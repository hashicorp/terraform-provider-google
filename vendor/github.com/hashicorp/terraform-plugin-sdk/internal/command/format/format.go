// Package format contains helpers for formatting various Terraform
// structures for human-readabout output.
//
// This package is used by the official Terraform CLI in formatting any
// output and is exported to encourage non-official frontends to mimic the
// output formatting as much as possible so that text formats of Terraform
// structures have a consistent look and feel.
