# Getting Started with the Google Provider

## Before you begin

* Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
and set up billing on that project. Any examples in this guide will be part of
the [GCP "always free" tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
* [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
and read the Terraform getting started guide that follows. This guide will
assume basic proficiency with Terraform - it is an introduction to the Google
provider.

## Configuring the Provider

First, authenticate with GCP.  The easiest way to do this is to run
`gcloud auth application-default login`, if you already have gcloud
installed.  If you don't already have it, gcloud can be installed with
`apt-get install google-cloud-sdk` on Debian-based machines.  For a
production use-case you will want to use service account authentication,
which you can learn about further down in this doc, but for experimenting
gcloud authentication will work fine.

Next, create a Terraform config file named `"main.tf"`. Inside, you'll
want to include the following configuration:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "{{YOUR GCP PROJECT}}"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}
```

* The `project` field should be your personal project id. The `project`
indicates the default GCP project all of your resources will be created in.
Most Terraform resources will have a `project` field.
* The `region` and `zone` are [locations](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/global-regional-zonal-resources)
for your resources to be created in.
    * The `region` will be used to choose the default location for regional
    resources. Regional resources are spread across several zones.
    * The `zone` will be used to choose the default location for zonal resources.
    Zonal resources exist in a single zone. All zones are a part of a region.

Not all resources require a location. Some GCP resources are global and are
automatically spread across all of GCP.

-> Want to try out another location? Check out the [list of available regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#available).
Instances created in zones outside the US are not necessarily part of the always free tier
and could incur charges.

## Creating a VM instance
A [Google Compute Engine VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/) is
named `google_compute_instance` in Terraform. The `google` part of the name
identifies the provider for Terraform, `compute` indicates the GCP product
family, and `instance` is the resource name.

Google provider resources will generally, although not always, be named after
the name used in `gcloud`/the REST API. For example, a VM instance is called
[`instance` in the API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances).
Most resource field names will also correspond 1:1 with their `gcloud`/REST API
names.

If you look at the [`google_compute_instance documentation`](/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance.html),
you'll see that `project` and `zone` (VM instances are a zonal resource) are
listed as optional. When present in a resource's config block, these values will
be used. If omitted, the provider defaults will be used instead.

Add the following to your config file:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    # A default network is created for all GCP projects
    network = "default"
    access_config {
    }
  }
}
```

~> Note: Don't use `terraform apply` quite yet! You still need to add GCP
credentials. If you want to try out provisioning your VM instance before
continuing, follow the instructions in the "Adding credentials" section below.

## Linking GCP resources

Like this VM instance, nearly every GCP resource will have a `name` field. They
are used as a short way to identify resources, and a resource's display name in
the Cloud Console will be the one defined in the `name` field.

When linking resources in a Terraform config though, you'll primarily want to
use a different field, the `self_link` of a resource. Like `name`, nearly every
resource has a `self_link`. They look like:

```
{{API base url}}/projects/{{your project}}/{{location type}}/{{location}}/{{resource type}}/{{name}}
```

For example, the instance defined earlier in a project named `foo` will have
the `self_link`:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/foo/zones/us-central1-c/instances/terraform-instance
```

A resource's `self_link` is a unique reference to that resource. When
linking two resources in Terraform, you can use Terraform interpolation to
avoid typing out the self link! Let's use a `google_compute_network` to
demonstrate.

Add this block to your config:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name                    = "terraform-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
}
```

This will create [VPC network resource](/docs/providers/google/r/compute_network.html)
with a subnetwork in each region. Next, change the network of the
`google_compute_instance` from the `"default"` network to the new network.

```diff
network_interface {
-  # A default network is created for all GCP projects
-  network = "default"
+  network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.self_link
  access_config {
```

This means that when we create the VM instance, it will use
`"terraform-network"` instead of the default VPC network for the project. If you
run `terraform plan`, you will see that `"terraform-instance"` depends on
`"terraform-network"`.

Your configuration is complete. Before you can run `terraform apply` though,
Terraform needs GCP credentials.

## Adding credentials
In order to make requests against the GCP API, you need to authenticate to prove
that it's you making the request. The preferred method of provisioning resources
with Terraform is to use a [GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started),
a "robot account" that can be granted a limited set of IAM permissions.

From [the service account key page in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)
choose an existing account, or create a new one. Next, download the JSON key
file. Name it something you can remember, and store it somewhere secure on your
machine.

> *Note*: Currently the only supported service account credentials are credentials
downloaded from Cloud Console or generated by `gcloud`.


You supply the key to Terraform using the environment variable
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, setting the value to the location of the file.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={{path}}
```

If you choose to use `gcloud`-generated credentials, and you encounter
quota or billing issues which don't seem to apply to you, you may want to set
`user_project_override` to `true` in the provider block - see the
[provider reference](/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html) for more information.

-> Remember to add this line to a startup file such as `bash_profile` or
`bashrc` to store your credentials across sessions!

## Provisioning your resources
By now, your config will look something like:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "{{YOUR GCP PROJECT}}"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    # A default network is created for all GCP projects
    network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.self_link
    access_config {
    }
  }
}

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name                    = "terraform-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
}
```

With a Terraform config and with your credentials configured, it's time to
provision your resources:

```hcl
terraform apply
```

Congratulations! You've gotten started using the Google provider and provisioned
a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform. The key concepts unique to GCP are:

* How a `project` contains resources
    * and how to use a default `project` in your provider
* What a resource being global, regional, or zonal means on GCP
    * and how to specify a default `region` and `zone`
* How GCP uses `name` and `self_link` to identify resources
* How to add GCP service account credentials to Terraform

Run `terraform destroy` to tear down your resources.

Afterwards, check out the [provider reference](/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html) for more details on configuring
the provider block (including how you can eliminate it entirely!).
