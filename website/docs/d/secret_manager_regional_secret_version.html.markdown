# google_secret_manager_regional_secret_version

Get the value and metadata from a Secret Manager regional secret version. For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/regional-secrets-overview) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.secrets.versions). If you don't need the metadata (i.e., if you want to use a more limited role to access the regional secret version only), see also the [google_secret_manager_regional_secret_version_access](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/secret_manager_regional_secret_version_access) datasource.

## Example Usage

data "google_secret_manager_regional_secret_version" "basic" {
  secret   = "my-secret"
  location = "us-central1"
}
