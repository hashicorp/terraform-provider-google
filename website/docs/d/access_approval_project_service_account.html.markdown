# google\_access\_approval\_project\_service\_account

Get the email address of a project's Access Approval service account.

Each Google Cloud project has a unique service account used by Access Approval.
When using Access Approval with a
[custom signing key](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-provider-access-management/access-approval/docs/review-approve-access-requests-custom-keys),
this account needs to be granted the `cloudkms.signerVerifier` IAM role on the
Cloud KMS key used to sign approvals.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "google_access_approval_project_service_account" "service_account" {
  project_id = "my-project"
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member" "iam" {
  crypto_key_id = google_kms_crypto_key.crypto_key.id
  role          = "roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier"
  member        = "serviceAccount:${data.google_access_approval_project_service_account.service_account.account_email}"
}
```
