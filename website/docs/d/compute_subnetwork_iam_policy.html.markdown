## example

```hcl
data "google_compute_subnetwork_iam_policy" "policy" {
  project = google_compute_subnetwork.network-with-private-secondary-ip-ranges.project
  region = google_compute_subnetwork.network-with-private-secondary-ip-ranges.region
  subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.network-with-private-secondary-ip-ranges.name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `subnetwork` - (Required) Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to
* `region` - (Optional) The GCP region for this subnetwork.
 Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to. If not specified,
  the value will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no region is provided in the parent identifier and no
  region is specified, it is taken from the provider configuration.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

The attributes are exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the IAM policy.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `google_compute_subnetwork_iam_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.
