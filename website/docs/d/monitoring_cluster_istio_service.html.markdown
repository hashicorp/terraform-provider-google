  An Monitoring Service resource created automatically by GCP to monitor an
  Cluster Istio service.

# google\_monitoring\_cluster\_istio\_service

A Monitoring Service is the root resource under which operational aspects of a
generic service are accessible. A service is some discrete, autonomous, and
network-accessible unit, designed to solve an individual concern

An Cluster Istio monitoring service is automatically created by GCP to monitor
Cluster Istio services.


To get more information about Service, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services)
* How-to Guides

## Example Usage - Monitoring Cluster Istio Service


```hcl
# Monitors the default ClusterIstio service
data "google_monitoring_cluster_istio_service" "default" {
        location = "us-west2-a"
        cluster_name = "west"
        service_namespace = "istio-system"
        service_name = "istio-policy"
}
```

  is defined. Corresponds to the clusterName resource label in k8s_cluster resources.

* `service_namespace` - (Required) The namespace of the Istio service underlying this service.
  Corresponds to the destination_service_namespace metric label in Istio metrics.

* `service_name` - (Required) The name of the Istio service underlying this service.
