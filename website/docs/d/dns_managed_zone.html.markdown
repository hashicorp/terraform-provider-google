## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project for the Google Cloud DNS zone.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `dns_name` - The fully qualified DNS name of this zone, e.g. `terraform.io.`.

* `description` - A textual description field.

* `name_servers` - The list of nameservers that will be authoritative for this
    domain. Use NS records to redirect from your DNS provider to these names,
    thus making Google Cloud DNS authoritative for this zone.
