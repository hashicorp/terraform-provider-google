## Example Usage

Retrieve all the supported permissions able to be set on `my-project` that are in either GA or BETA. This is useful for dynamically constructing custom roles.

```hcl
data "google_iam_testable_permissions" "perms" {
	full_resource_name = "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project"
	stages             = ["GA", "BETA"]
}
```
