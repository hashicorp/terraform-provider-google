---


# `google_api_gateway_gateway_iam_policy`
Retrieves the current IAM policy data for gateway
~> **Warning:** This datasource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.


## example

```hcl
data "google_api_gateway_gateway_iam_policy" "policy" {
  provider = google-beta
  project = google_api_gateway_gateway.api_gw.project
  region = google_api_gateway_gateway.api_gw.region
  gateway = google_api_gateway_gateway.api_gw.gateway_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region of the gateway for the API.
 Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to. If not specified,
  the value will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no region is provided in the parent identifier and no
  region is specified, it is taken from the provider configuration.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

The attributes are exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the IAM policy.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `google_api_gateway_gateway_iam_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.
