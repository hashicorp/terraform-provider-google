# google_secret_manager_secret_version

Get the value and metadata from a Secret Manager secret version. For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.secrets.versions). If you don't need the metadata (i.e., if you want to use a more limited role to access the secret version only), see also the [google_secret_manager_secret_version_access](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/secret_manager_secret_version_access) datasource.
