  Get a Google Cloud Platform service account Public Key
---

# google_service_account_key

Get an ephemeral service account public key. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts.keys/get).

## Example Usage

-> **Note:** If you run this example configuration you will be able to see ephemeral.google_service_account_key.mykey in terraform plan and apply terminal output but you will not see it in state, as ephemeral resources are excluded from state. In future, when write-only attributes are added to resources in the Google provider, ephemeral resources such as google_service_account_key could be used to set field values when creating managed resources.


```hcl
resource "google_service_account" "myaccount" {
  account_id = "dev-foo-account"
}

resource "google_service_account_key" "mykey" {
  service_account_id = google_service_account.myaccount.name
}

ephemeral "google_service_account_key" "mykey" {
  name            = google_service_account_key.mykey.name
  public_key_type = "TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the service account key. This must have format
  `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{KEYID}`, where `{ACCOUNT}`
  is the email address or unique id of the service account.

* `public_key_type` (Optional) The output format of the public key requested. TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE is the default output format.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the arguments listed above:

* `public_key` - The public key, base64 encoded
