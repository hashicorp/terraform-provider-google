# Google Cloud Platform Provider

-> We recently introduced the `google-beta` provider. See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)
for more details on how to use `google-beta`.

The Google provider is used to configure your [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) infrastructure. 
See the [Getting Started](/docs/providers/google/getting_started.html) page for an introduction to using the provider.

A typical provider configuration will look something like:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  credentials = "${file("account.json")}"
  project     = "my-project-id"
  region      = "us-central1"
}
```

See the [provider reference](/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html)
for more details on authenticating or otherwise configuring the provider.

Interested in the provider's latest features, or want to make sure you're up to date?
Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for version information and release notes.

Take advantage of [Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html)
to simplify your config by browsing the [Module Registry for GCP modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse?provider=google).

The Google provider is jointly maintained by:

* The [Google Cloud Graphite Team](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/partnering-on-open-source-Google-and-HashiCorp-engineers-on-managing-GCP-infrastructure.html) at Google
* The Terraform team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)

If you have configuration questions, or general questions about using the provider, try checking out:

* The [Google Cloud Platform Community Slack](https://gcp-slack.appspot.com/) #terraform channel
* [Terraform's community resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/community/index.html)
* [HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com) for Terraform Enterprise customers

## Features and Bug Requests

The Google provider's bugs and feature requests can be found in the [GitHub repo issues](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues).
Please avoid "me too" or "+1" comments. Instead, use a thumbs up [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on enhancement requests. Provider maintainers will often prioritize work based on the
number of thumbs on an issue.

Community input is appreciated on outstanding issues! We love to hear what use
cases you have for new features, and want to provide the best possible
experience for you using the Google provider.

If you have a bug or feature request without an existing issue

* and an existing resource or field is working in an unexpected way, [file a bug](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=bug.md).

* and you'd like the provider to support a new resource or field, [file an enhancement/feature request](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=enhancement.md).

The provider maintainers will often use the assignee field on an issue to mark
who is working on it.

* An issue assigned to an individual maintainer indicates that maintainer is working
on the issue
* An issue assigned to the `modular-magician` indicates the feature is being
autogenerated by [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules)
in the immediate future, so direct contributions to that resource are discouraged.
* An issue assigned to `hashibot` indicates a member of the community has taken on
the issue!

## Contributing

If you'd like to help extend the Google provider, we gladly accept community
contributions! Pull requests should be made against [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules)
to ensure they are applied to both `google` and `google-beta`.

Check out the [Magic Modules setup guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules#one-time-setup) to get set up, the [provider README](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google)
for instructions about running your generated code, the [HashiCorp contribution guidelines](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for a Terraform provider development overview, and the [Google provider contribution guidelines](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for our provider-specific advice.

## GCP API Versions

The Google provider supports generally available (GA) and Beta GCP features. We
are focusing on filling out general GA feature coverage and on adding support
for beta features that customers request. If you need us to support a feature
whether GA or beta, please [file a feature request](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=enhancement.md)!

If you're interested in using Alpha GCP features, you should still [file a feature request](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=enhancement.md)
or thumbs up [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
the existing request if one exists. By filing and reacting to requests, we can
gauge your interest in yet-to-be-supported GCP features and make sure that we
prioritize support for them when they enter Beta.
