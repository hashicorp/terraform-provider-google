# google\_network\_services\_grpc\_route

GrpcRoute is the resource defining how gRPC traffic routed by a Mesh or Gateway resource is routed.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about GrpcRoute, see:
