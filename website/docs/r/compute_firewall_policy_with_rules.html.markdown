* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A description of the rule.

* `rule_name` -
  (Optional)
  An optional name for the rule. This field is not a unique identifier
  and can be updated.

* `priority` -
  (Required)
  An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a value
  between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the
  highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.

* `match` -
  (Required)
  A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rule_rule_match).

* `target_secure_tag` -
  (Optional)
  A list of secure tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
  applies to. If <code>targetSecureTag</code> are specified, then the
  firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one
  of those EFFECTIVE secure tags, if all the target_secure_tag are in
  INEFFECTIVE state, then this rule will be ignored.
  <code>targetSecureTag</code> may not be set at the same time as
  <code>targetServiceAccounts</code>.
  If neither <code>targetServiceAccounts</code> nor
  <code>targetSecureTag</code> are specified, the firewall rule applies
  to all instances on the specified network.
  Maximum number of target secure tags allowed is 256.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rule_rule_target_secure_tag).

* `action` -
  (Required)
  The Action to perform when the client connection triggers the rule. Can currently be either
  "allow", "deny", "apply_security_profile_group" or "goto_next".

* `direction` -
  (Optional)
  The direction in which this rule applies. If unspecified an INGRESS rule is created.
  Possible values are: `INGRESS`, `EGRESS`.

* `target_resources` -
  (Optional)
  A list of network resource URLs to which this rule applies.
  This field allows you to control which network's VMs get
  this rule. If this field is left blank, all VMs
  within the organization will receive the rule.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether the firewall policy rule is disabled. When set to true,
  the firewall policy rule is not enforced and traffic behaves as if it did
  not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall policy rule will be

* `locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{policy_id}}`
* `{{policy_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FirewallPolicyWithRules using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{policy_id}}"
  to = google_compute_firewall_policy_with_rules.default
