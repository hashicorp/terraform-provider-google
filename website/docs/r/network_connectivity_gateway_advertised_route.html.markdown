## Example Usage - Network Connectivity Gateway Advertised Route Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "network" {
  provider = google-beta
  name        = "net-spoke"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnetwork" {
  provider = google-beta
  name          = "tf-test-subnet%{random_suffix}"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/28"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.network.self_link
}

resource "google_network_connectivity_hub" "basic_hub" {
  provider = google-beta
  name        = "hub"
  description = "A sample hub"
  labels = {
    label-two = "value-one"
  }
  preset_topology = "HYBRID_INSPECTION"
}

resource "google_network_connectivity_spoke" "primary" {
  provider = google-beta
  name        = "spoke-name"
  location = "us-central1"
  description = "A sample spoke of type Gateway"
  labels = {
    label-one = "value-one"
  }
  hub =  google_network_connectivity_hub.basic_hub.id
  gateway {
    ip_range_reservations {
      ip_range = "10.0.0.0/23"
    }
    capacity = "CAPACITY_1_GBPS"
  }
  group = "gateways"
}

resource "google_network_connectivity_gateway_advertised_route" "default" {
  provider      = google-beta
  spoke         = google_network_connectivity_spoke.primary.name
  location      = "us-central1"
  name          = "gateway-advertised-route-name"
  labels = {
    label-one = "value-one"
  }
  description   = "description of the gateway advertised route"
  ip_range      = "0.0.0.0/24"
  recipient     = "ADVERTISE_TO_HUB"
  priority      = 200
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the gateway advertised route. Route names must be unique.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource

* `spoke` -
  (Required)
  The name of the spoke


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional labels in key:value format. For more information about labels, see [Requirements for labels](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements).
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of the gateway advertised route.

* `ip_range` -
  (Optional)
  This route's advertised IP address range. Must be a valid CIDR-formatted prefix.
  If an IP address is provided without a subnet mask, it is interpreted as, for IPv4, a /32 singular IP address range, and, for IPv6, /128

* `recipient` -
  (Optional)
  the recipient of this advertised route
  Possible values are: `RECIPIENT_UNSPECIFIED`, `ADVERTISE_TO_HUB`.

* `priority` -
  (Optional)
  The priority of this advertised route. You can choose a value from 0 to 65335.
  If you don't provide a value, Google Cloud assigns a priority of 100 to the ranges.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/spokes/{{spoke}}/gatewayAdvertisedRoutes/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  The time the gateway advertised route was created.

* `update_time` -
  The time the gateway advertised route was last updated.

* `unique_id` -
  The Google-generated UUID for the gateway advertised route.
  This value is unique across all gateway advertised route resources.
  If a gateway advertised route is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new route is assigned a different uniqueId.

* `state` -
  The current lifecycle state of this gateway advertised route.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.
