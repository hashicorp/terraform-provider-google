}

resource "google_compute_backend_bucket_signed_url_key" "backend_key" {
  name           = "test-key"
  key_value      = random_id.url_signature.b64_url
  backend_bucket = google_compute_backend_bucket.test_backend.name
}

resource "google_compute_backend_bucket" "test_backend" {
  name        = "test-signed-backend-bucket"
  description = "Contains beautiful images"
  bucket_name = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  enable_cdn  = true
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name     = "test-storage-bucket"
