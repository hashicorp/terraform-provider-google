# google\_compute\_backend\_bucket\_signed\_url\_key

A key for signing Cloud CDN signed URLs for BackendBuckets.


To get more information about BackendBucketSignedUrlKey, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendBuckets)
* How-to Guides
    * [Using Signed URLs](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/using-signed-urls/)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the key's value will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
Because the API does not return the sensitive key value,
we cannot confirm or reverse changes to a key outside of Terraform.
