Restricts access to Cloud Console and Google Cloud APIs for a set of users using Context-Aware Access.


To get more information about GcpUserAccessBinding, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.gcpUserAccessBindings)

## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Gcp User Access Binding Basic


```hcl
resource "google_cloud_identity_group" "group" {
  display_name = "my-identity-group"

  parent = "customers/A01b123xz"

  group_key {
    id = "my-identity-group@example.com"
  }

  labels = {
    "cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum" = ""
  }
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_level" "access_level_id_for_user_access_binding" {
  parent = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}"
  name   = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}/accessLevels/chromeos_no_lock"
  title  = "chromeos_no_lock"
  basic {
    conditions {
      device_policy {
        require_screen_lock = true
        os_constraints {
          os_type = "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS"
        }
      }
      regions = [
  "US",
      ]
    }
  }
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "access-policy" {
  parent = "organizations/123456789"
  title  = "my policy"
}



resource "google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding" "gcp_user_access_binding" {
  organization_id = "123456789"
  group_key       = trimprefix(google_cloud_identity_group.group.id, "groups/")
  access_levels   = [
    google_access_context_manager_access_level.access_level_id_for_user_access_binding.name,
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `group_key` -
  (Required)
  Required. Immutable. Google Group id whose members are subject to this binding's restrictions. See "id" in the G Suite Directory API's Groups resource. If a group's email address/alias is changed, this resource will continue to point at the changed group. This field does not accept group email addresses or aliases. Example: "01d520gv4vjcrht"

* `access_levels` -
  (Required)
  Required. Access level that a user must have to be granted access. Only one access level is supported, not multiple. This repeated field must have exactly one element. Example: "accessPolicies/9522/accessLevels/device_trusted"

* `organization_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. ID of the parent organization.
