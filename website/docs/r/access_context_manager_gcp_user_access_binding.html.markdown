# google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding

Restricts access to Cloud Console and Google Cloud APIs for a set of users using Context-Aware Access.


To get more information about GcpUserAccessBinding, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.gcpUserAccessBindings)

## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Gcp User Access Binding Basic


```hcl
resource "google_cloud_identity_group" "group" {
  display_name = "my-identity-group"

  parent = "customers/A01b123xz"

  group_key {
    id = "my-identity-group@example.com"
  }

  labels = {
    "cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum" = ""
  }
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_level" "access_level_id_for_user_access_binding" {
  parent = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}"
  name   = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}/accessLevels/chromeos_no_lock"
  title  = "chromeos_no_lock"
  basic {
    conditions {
      device_policy {
        require_screen_lock = true
        os_constraints {
          os_type = "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS"
        }
      }
      regions = [
  "US",
      ]
    }
  }
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "access-policy" {
  parent = "organizations/123456789"
  title  = "my policy"
}



resource "google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding" "gcp_user_access_binding" {
  organization_id = "123456789"
  group_key       = trimprefix(google_cloud_identity_group.group.id, "groups/")
  access_levels   = [
    google_access_context_manager_access_level.access_level_id_for_user_access_binding.name,
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `group_key` -
  (Required)
  Required. Immutable. Google Group id whose members are subject to this binding's restrictions. See "id" in the G Suite Directory API's Groups resource. If a group's email address/alias is changed, this resource will continue to point at the changed group. This field does not accept group email addresses or aliases. Example: "01d520gv4vjcrht"

* `organization_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. ID of the parent organization.


* `access_levels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Access level that a user must have to be granted access. Only one access level is supported, not multiple. This repeated field must have exactly one element. Example: "accessPolicies/9522/accessLevels/device_trusted"

* `session_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The Google Cloud session length (GCSL) policy for the group key.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_session_settings).

* `scoped_access_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A list of scoped access settings that set this binding's restrictions on a subset of applications.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings).



<a name="nested_session_settings"></a>The `session_settings` block supports:

* `session_reauth_method` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The session challenges proposed to users when the Google Cloud session length is up.
  Possible values are: `LOGIN`, `SECURITY_KEY`, `PASSWORD`.

* `session_length` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The session length. Setting this field to zero is equal to disabling session. Also can set infinite session by flipping the enabled bit to false below. If useOidcMaxAge is true, for OIDC apps, the session length will be the minimum of this field and OIDC max_age param.

* `max_inactivity` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. How long a user is allowed to take between actions before a new access token must be issued. Only set for Google Cloud apps.

* `use_oidc_max_age` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Only useful for OIDC apps. When false, the OIDC max_age param, if passed in the authentication request will be ignored. When true, the re-auth period will be the minimum of the sessionLength field and the max_age OIDC param.

* `session_length_enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. This field enables or disables Google Cloud session length. When false, all fields set above will be disregarded and the session length is basically infinite.

<a name="nested_scoped_access_settings"></a>The `scoped_access_settings` block supports:

* `scope` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Application, etc. to which the access settings will be applied to. Implicitly, this is the scoped access settings key; as such, it must be unique and non-empty.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_scope).

* `active_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Access settings for this scoped access settings. This field may be empty if dryRunSettings is set.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_active_settings).

* `dry_run_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Dry-run access settings for this scoped access settings. This field may be empty if activeSettings is set. Cannot contain session settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_dry_run_settings).


<a name="nested_scoped_access_settings_scope"></a>The `scope` block supports:

* `client_scope` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Client scope for this access scope.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_scope_client_scope).


<a name="nested_scoped_access_settings_scope_client_scope"></a>The `client_scope` block supports:

* `restricted_client_application` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The application that is subject to this binding's scope. Only one of clientId or name should be specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_scope_client_scope_restricted_client_application).


<a name="nested_scoped_access_settings_scope_client_scope_restricted_client_application"></a>The `restricted_client_application` block supports:

* `client_id` -
  (Optional)
  The OAuth client ID of the application.

* `name` -

  The name of the application. Example: "Cloud Console"

<a name="nested_scoped_access_settings_active_settings"></a>The `active_settings` block supports:

* `access_levels` -

* `session_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Session settings applied to user access on a given AccessScope.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_scoped_access_settings_active_settings_session_settings).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

* `name` -
  Immutable. Assigned by the server during creation. The last segment has an arbitrary length and has only URI unreserved characters (as defined by RFC 3986 Section 2.3). Should not be specified by the client during creation. Example: "organizations/256/gcpUserAccessBindings/b3-BhcX_Ud5N"


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


GcpUserAccessBinding can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{name}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import GcpUserAccessBinding using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    name = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GcpUserAccessBinding using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{name}}"
  to = google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), GcpUserAccessBinding can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_access_context_manager_gcp_user_access_binding.default {{name}}
```
