# google\_privateca\_ca\_pool

A CaPool represents a group of CertificateAuthorities that form a trust anchor. A CaPool can be used to manage
issuance policies for one or more CertificateAuthority resources and to rotate CA certificates in and out of the
trust anchor.

  Structure is documented below.

* `publishing_options` -
  (Optional)
  The PublishingOptions to follow when issuing Certificates from any CertificateAuthority in this CaPool.
  Structure is documented below.

  Structure is documented below.

* `maximum_lifetime` -
  (Optional)
  The maximum lifetime allowed for issued Certificates. Note that if the issuing CertificateAuthority
  expires before a Certificate's requested maximumLifetime, the effective lifetime will be explicitly truncated to match it.
