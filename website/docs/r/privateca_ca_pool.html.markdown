# google\_privateca\_ca\_pool

A CaPool represents a group of CertificateAuthorities that form a trust anchor. A CaPool can be used to manage
issuance policies for one or more CertificateAuthority resources and to rotate CA certificates in and out of the
trust anchor.

  Otherwise, any key may be used.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_allowed_key_types).

* `maximum_lifetime` -
  (Optional)
  The maximum lifetime allowed for issued Certificates. Note that if the issuing CertificateAuthority
  expires before a Certificate's requested maximumLifetime, the effective lifetime will be explicitly truncated to match it.
