# google\_compute\_http\_health\_check

An HttpHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTP.


~> **Note:** google_compute_http_health_check is a legacy health check.
The newer [google_compute_health_check](/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html)
should be preferred for all uses except
[Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
which still require the legacy version.


To get more information about HttpHealthCheck, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/httpHealthChecks)
* How-to Guides
    * [Adding Health Checks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks#legacy_health_checks)

## Example Usage - Http Health Check Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_http_health_check" "default" {
  name         = "authentication-health-check"
  request_path = "/health_check"

  timeout_sec        = 1
  check_interval_sec = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
  match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
  the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the
  last character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `check_interval_sec` -
  (Optional)
  How often (in seconds) to send a health check. The default value is 5
  seconds.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
  you create the resource.

* `healthy_threshold` -
  (Optional)
  A so-far unhealthy instance will be marked healthy after this many
  consecutive successes. The default value is 2.

* `host` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the host header in the HTTP health check request. If
  left empty (default value), the public IP on behalf of which this
  health check is performed will be used.

* `port` -
  (Optional)
  The TCP port number for the HTTP health check request.
  The default value is 80.

* `request_path` -
  (Optional)
  The request path of the HTTP health check request.
  The default value is /.

* `timeout_sec` -
  (Optional)
  How long (in seconds) to wait before claiming failure.
  The default value is 5 seconds.  It is invalid for timeoutSec to have
  greater value than checkIntervalSec.

* `unhealthy_threshold` -
  (Optional)
  A so-far healthy instance will be marked unhealthy after this many
  consecutive failures. The default value is 2.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/httpHealthChecks/{{name}}`

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.
