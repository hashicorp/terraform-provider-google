## Example Usage - Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Basic


```hcl

resource "google_network_services_edge_cache_keyset" "default" {
  name                 = "default"
  description          = "The default keyset"
  public_key {
    id = "my-public-key"
    value = "FHsTyFHNmvNpw4o7-rp-M1yqMyBF8vXSBRkZtkQ0RKY"
  }
  public_key {
    id = "my-public-key-2"
    value = "hzd03llxB1u5FOLKFkZ6_wCJqC7jtN0bg7xlBqS6WVM"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `public_key` -
  (Required)
  An ordered list of Ed25519 public keys to use for validating signed requests.
  You must specify at least one (1) key, and may have up to three (3) keys.
  Ed25519 public keys are not secret, and only allow Google to validate a request was signed by your corresponding private key.
  You should ensure that the private key is kept secret, and that only authorized users can add public keys to a keyset.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_public_key).

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
  The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]* which means the first character must be a letter,
  and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.


<a name="nested_public_key"></a>The `public_key` block supports:

* `id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the public key. The ID must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
  The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*
  which means the first character must be a letter, and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.

* `value` -
  (Required)
  The base64-encoded value of the Ed25519 public key. The base64 encoding can be padded (44 bytes) or unpadded (43 bytes).
  Representations or encodings of the public key other than this will be rejected with an error.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-readable description of the resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/{{name}}`
