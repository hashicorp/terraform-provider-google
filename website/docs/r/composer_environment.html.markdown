# google\_composer\_environment

An environment for running orchestration tasks.

Environments run Apache Airflow software on Google infrastructure.

~> **Warning:** We **STRONGLY** recommend you read the [GCP
guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to) as the Environment resource requires a long
deployment process and involves several layers of GCP infrastructure, including a Kubernetes Engine
cluster, Cloud Storage, and Compute networking resources. Due to limitations of the API, Terraform
will not be able to automatically find or manage many of these underlying resources. In particular:
* It can take up to one hour to create or update an environment resource. In addition, GCP may only
  detect some errors in configuration when they are used (e.g. ~40-50 minutes into the creation
  process), and is prone to limited error reporting. If you encounter confusing or uninformative
  errors, please verify your configuration is valid against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs
  against the Terraform provider. * **Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that do not get
  cleaned up automatically** on environment deletion. [More about Composer's use of Cloud
  Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage). * Please review the [known
  issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/known-issues) for Composer if you are having
  problems.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage (Cloud Composer 1)
```hcl
resource "google_composer_environment" "test" {
  name   = "example-composer-env"
  region = "us-central1"
}
```

### Basic Usage (Cloud Composer 2)
```hcl
resource "google_composer_environment" "test" {
  name   = "example-composer-env"
  region = "us-central1"
 config {
    software_config {
      image_version = "composer-2-airflow-2"
    }
  }
}
```

### With GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies

**NOTE** To use custom service accounts, you need to give at least `role/composer.worker` to the service account being used by the GKE Nodes on the Composer project.
For more information, see the [Access Control](https://cloud.devsite.corp.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/access-control) page in the Cloud Composer documentation.
You may need to assign additional roles depending on what the Airflow DAGs will be running.

**NOTE** We STRONGLY recommend you read the [Cloud Composer guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to)
as the Environment
resource requires a long deployment process and involves several layers of
Google Cloud infrastructure, including a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud
Storage, and Compute networking resources. Composer manages most of these
resources fully and as a result, Terraform may not be able to automatically
find or manage the underlying resources. In particular:
* It can take up to 50 minutes to create or update an environment resource and
some errors may be detected later in the process. Also, some error messages may
not be clear at first sight because they involve issues with the underlying
resources. If you encounter such errors, please review Composer logs and verify
if your configuration is valid against Cloud Composer before filing bugs
against the Terraform provider.
* Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that contain your DAGs and
other work files. These buckets do not get deleted automatically on environment
deletion. This is by design; it ensures that DAGs source code and other
valuable data donâ€™t get lost when an environment is deleted. [More about
Composer's use of Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage).
* Please review the [known issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/known-issues) for Cloud Composer if you are having problems.

  The Compute Engine network to be used for machine
  communications, specified as a self-link, relative resource name

  Configuration for controlling how IPs are allocated in the GKE cluster.
  Structure is documented below.
  Cannot be updated.

* `enable_ip_masq_agent` -

  IP Masq Agent translates Pod IP addresses to node IP addresses, so that 
  destinations and services targeted from Airflow DAGs and tasks only receive 
  packets from node IP addresses instead of Pod IP addresses
  See the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/enable-ip-masquerade-agent).

The `software_config` block supports:

* `airflow_config_overrides` -
  (Optional) Apache Airflow configuration properties to override. Property keys contain the section and property names,
  separated by a hyphen, for example "core-dags_are_paused_at_creation".

  Section names must not contain hyphens ("-"), opening square brackets ("["), or closing square brackets ("]").
  The property name must not be empty and cannot contain "=" or ";". Section and property names cannot contain
  characters: "." Apache Airflow configuration property names must be written in snake_case. Property values can
  contain any character, and can be written in any lower/upper case format. Certain Apache Airflow configuration

  and cannot be overridden.

* `pypi_packages` -
  (Optional)
  Custom Python Package Index (PyPI) packages to be installed
  in the environment. Keys refer to the lowercase package name (e.g. "numpy"). Values are the lowercase extras and
  version specifier (e.g. "==1.12.0", "[devel,gcp_api]", "[devel]>=1.8.2, <1.9.2"). To specify a package without
  pinning it to a version specifier, use the empty string as the value.

* `env_variables` -
  (Optional)
  Additional environment variables to provide to the Apache Airflow scheduler, worker, and webserver processes.
  Environment variable names must match the regular expression `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
  They cannot specify Apache Airflow software configuration overrides (they cannot match the regular expression
  `AIRFLOW__[A-Z0-9_]+__[A-Z0-9_]+`), and they cannot match any of the following reserved names:
  ```
  AIRFLOW_HOME
  C_FORCE_ROOT
  CONTAINER_NAME
  DAGS_FOLDER
  GCP_PROJECT
  GCS_BUCKET
  GKE_CLUSTER_NAME
  SQL_DATABASE
  SQL_INSTANCE
  SQL_PASSWORD
  SQL_PROJECT
  SQL_REGION
  SQL_USER
  ```

* `image_version` -
  (Required in Cloud Composer 2, optional in Cloud Composer 1)

  **In Cloud Composer 2, you must specify an image with Cloud Composer 2**. Otherwise, the default image for Cloud Composer 1 is used. For more information about Cloud Composer images, see
  [Cloud Composer version list](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions).

  The version of the software running in the environment. This encapsulates both the version of Cloud Composer
  functionality and the version of Apache Airflow. It must match the regular expression
  `composer-([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-preview\.[0-9]+)?)?|latest)-airflow-([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)?)`.
  The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a full semantic version, or an alias in the form of major
  version number or 'latest'.
  The Apache Airflow portion of the image version is a full semantic version that points to one of the
  supported Apache Airflow versions, or an alias in the form of only major or major.minor versions specified.
  **Important**: In-place upgrade is only available using `google-beta` provider. It's because updating the
  `image_version` is still in beta. Using `google-beta` provider, you can upgrade in-place between minor or
  patch versions of Cloud Composer or Apache Airflow. For example, you can upgrade your environment from
  `composer-1.16.x` to `composer-1.17.x`, or from `airflow-2.1.x` to `airflow-2.2.x`. You cannot upgrade between
  major Cloud Composer or Apache Airflow versions (from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x`). To do so, create a new environment.
