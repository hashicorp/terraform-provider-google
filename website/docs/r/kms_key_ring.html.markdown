# google\_kms\_key\_ring

A `KeyRing` is a toplevel logical grouping of `CryptoKeys`.


~> **Note:** KeyRings cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
Destroying a Terraform-managed KeyRing will remove it from state but
*will not delete the resource on the server.*


To get more information about KeyRing, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a key ring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys#create_a_key_ring)

## Example Usage - Kms Key Ring Basic


```hcl
resource "google_kms_key_ring" "example-keyring" {
  name     = "keyring-example"
  location = "global"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name for the KeyRing.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the KeyRing.
  A full list of valid locations can be found by running `gcloud kms locations list`.


- - -


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:



* `self_link`: The self link of the created KeyRing in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{name}`

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

KeyRing can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_kms_key_ring.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/keyRings/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_kms_key_ring.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_kms_key_ring.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
