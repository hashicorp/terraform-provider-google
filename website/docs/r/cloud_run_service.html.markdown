# google\_cloud\_run\_service

Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and
Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a
singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and
which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and
team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the
underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
orchestrates ReplicaSets).

The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.
