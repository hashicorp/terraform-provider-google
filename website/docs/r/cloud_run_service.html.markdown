# google\_cloud\_run\_service

A Cloud Run service has a unique endpoint and autoscales containers.


To get more information about Service, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/namespaces.services)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/)

~> **Warning:** We recommend using the `google_cloud_run_v2_service` resource which offers a better
developer experience and broader support of Cloud Run features.

## Example Usage - Cloud Run Service Basic

        image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
      }
    }
  }

  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}

<a name="nested_volumes"></a>The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Volume's name.

  (Optional)
  The secret's value will be presented as the content of a file whose
  name is defined in the item path. If no items are defined, the name of
  the file is the secret_name.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_secret).

* `empty_dir` -
  (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
  Ephemeral storage which can be backed by real disks (HD, SSD), network storage or memory (i.e. tmpfs). For now only in memory (tmpfs) is supported. It is ephemeral in the sense that when the sandbox is taken down, the data is destroyed with it (it does not persist across sandbox runs).
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_empty_dir).

* `csi` -
  (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))

  is assumed to be in the same project.
  If the secret is in another project, you must define an alias.
  An alias definition has the form:

* `default_mode` -
  (Optional)
  Mode bits to use on created files by default. Must be a value between 0000
  and 0777. Defaults to 0644. Directories within the path are not affected by
  this setting. This might be in conflict with other options that affect the
  file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.

* `items` -
  (Optional)
  If unspecified, the volume will expose a file whose name is the
  secret_name.
  If specified, the key will be used as the version to fetch from Cloud
  Secret Manager and the path will be the name of the file exposed in the
  volume. When items are defined, they must specify a key and a path.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_items).


<a name="nested_items"></a>The `items` block supports:

* `medium` -
  (Optional)
  The medium on which the data is stored. The default is "" which means to use the node's default medium. Must be an empty string (default) or Memory.

* `size_limit` -
  (Optional)
  Limit on the storage usable by this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. This field's values are of the 'Quantity' k8s type: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir.

<a name="nested_csi"></a>The `csi` block supports:

* `driver` -
  (Required)
  Unique name representing the type of file system to be created. Cloud Run supports the following values:

  be stamped out. The template references the container image, and may also
  include labels and annotations that should be attached to the Revision.
  To correlate a Revision, and/or to force a Revision to be created when the
  spec doesn't otherwise change, a nonce label may be provided in the
  template metadata. For more details, see:
  https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/docs/client-conventions.md#associate-modifications-with-revisions
  Cloud Run does not currently support referencing a build that is
  responsible for materializing the container image from source.

autogenerated by Cloud Run. This cannot be set to `true` while `template.metadata.name`
is also set.

this field is set to false, the revision name will still autogenerate.)


<a name="nested_metadata"></a>The `metadata` block supports:

  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
  (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers

  for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
  resource or set of resources. They may only be valid for a
  particular resource or set of resources.

* `self_link` -
  (Output)
  SelfLink is a URL representing this object.

* `uid` -
  (Output)
  UID is a unique id generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
  allowed to change on PUT operations.

  info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations
  **Note**: The Cloud Run API may add additional annotations that were not provided in your config.
  If terraform plan shows a diff where a server-side annotation is added, you can add it to your config
  or apply the lifecycle.ignore_changes rule to the metadata.0.annotations field.
  Annotations with `run.googleapis.com/` and `autoscaling.knative.dev` are restricted. Use the following annotation
  keys to configure features on a Service:
