# google\_cloud\_run\_service

Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and
Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a
singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and
which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and
team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the
underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
orchestrates ReplicaSets).

The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

~> **Warning:** `google_cloudrun_service` creates a Managed Google Cloud Run Service. If you need to create
a Cloud Run Service on Anthos(GKE/VMWare) then you will need to create it using the kubernetes alpha provider.
Have a look at the Cloud Run Anthos example below.

## Example Usage - Cloud Run Service Basic


```hcl
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "default" {
  name     = "cloudrun-srv"
  location = "us-central1"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
      }
    }
  }

  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}
```
<div class = "oics-button" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 -15px">

  volume. When items are defined, they must specify a key and a path.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_items).


<a name="nested_items"></a>The `items` block supports:

* `key` -
  (Required)
  The Cloud Secret Manager secret version.
  Can be 'latest' for the latest value or an integer for a specific version.

* `path` -
  (Required)
  The relative path of the file to map the key to.
  May not be an absolute path.
  May not contain the path element '..'.
  May not start with the string '..'.

* `mode` -
  (Optional)
  Mode bits to use on this file, must be a value between 0000 and 0777. If
  not specified, the volume defaultMode will be used. This might be in
  conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and
  the result can be other mode bits set.

- - -


* `traffic` -
  (Optional)
  Traffic specifies how to distribute traffic over a collection of Knative Revisions
  and Configurations
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_traffic).

* `template` -
  (Optional)
  template holds the latest specification for the Revision to
  be stamped out. The template references the container image, and may also
  include labels and annotations that should be attached to the Revision.
  To correlate a Revision, and/or to force a Revision to be created when the
  spec doesn't otherwise change, a nonce label may be provided in the
  template metadata. For more details, see:
  https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/client-conventions.md#associate-modifications-with-revisions
  Cloud Run does not currently support referencing a build that is
  responsible for materializing the container image from source.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_template).

* `metadata` -
  (Optional)
  Metadata associated with this Service, including name, namespace, labels,
  and annotations.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_metadata).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `autogenerate_revision_name` - (Optional) If set to `true`, the revision name (template.metadata.name) will be omitted and
autogenerated by Cloud Run. This cannot be set to `true` while `template.metadata.name`
is also set.
(For legacy support, if `template.metadata.name` is unset in state while
this field is set to false, the revision name will still autogenerate.)


<a name="nested_metadata"></a>The `metadata` block supports:

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
  (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
  and routes.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

* `generation` -
  A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.

* `resource_version` -
  An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that
  can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used
  for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
  resource or set of resources. They may only be valid for a
  particular resource or set of resources.
  More info:
  https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

* `self_link` -
  SelfLink is a URL representing this object.

* `uid` -
  UID is a unique id generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
  allowed to change on PUT operations.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

* `namespace` -
  (Optional)
  In Cloud Run the namespace must be equal to either the
  project ID or project number.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Annotations is a key value map stored with a resource that
  may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. More
  info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
  **Note**: The Cloud Run API may add additional annotations that were not provided in your config.
  If terraform plan shows a diff where a server-side annotation is added, you can add it to your config
  or apply the lifecycle.ignore_changes rule to the metadata.0.annotations field.
  Cloud Run (fully managed) uses the following annotation keys to configure features on a Service:
  - `run.googleapis.com/ingress` sets the [ingress settings](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#--ingress)
    for the Service. For example, `"run.googleapis.com/ingress" = "all"`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `locations/{{location}}/namespaces/{{project}}/services/{{name}}`

* `status` -
  The current status of the Service.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_status).


<a name="nested_status"></a>The `status` block contains:

* `conditions` -
  Array of observed Service Conditions, indicating the current ready state of the service.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conditions).

* `url` -
  From RouteStatus. URL holds the url that will distribute traffic over the provided traffic
  targets. It generally has the form
  https://{route-hash}-{project-hash}-{cluster-level-suffix}.a.run.app

* `observed_generation` -
  ObservedGeneration is the 'Generation' of the Route that was last processed by the
  controller.
  Clients polling for completed reconciliation should poll until observedGeneration =
  metadata.generation and the Ready condition's status is True or False.

* `latest_created_revision_name` -
  From ConfigurationStatus. LatestCreatedRevisionName is the last revision that was created
  from this Service's Configuration. It might not be ready yet, for that use
  LatestReadyRevisionName.

* `latest_ready_revision_name` -
  From ConfigurationStatus. LatestReadyRevisionName holds the name of the latest Revision
  stamped out from this Service's Configuration that has had its "Ready" condition become
  "True".


<a name="nested_conditions"></a>The `conditions` block contains:

* `message` -
  Human readable message indicating details about the current status.

* `status` -
  Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

* `reason` -
  One-word CamelCase reason for the condition's current status.

* `type` -
  Type of domain mapping condition.
