## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Basic


```hcl
resource "google_network_security_address_group" "default" {
  name        = "my-address-groups"
  parent      = "projects/my-project-name"
  location    = "us-central1"
  type        = "IPV4"
  capacity    = "100"
  items       = ["208.80.154.224/32"]
}
```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Organization Basic


```hcl
resource "google_network_security_address_group" "default" {
  name        = "my-address-groups"
  parent      = "organizations/123456789"
  location    = "us-central1"
  type        = "IPV4"
  capacity    = "100"
  items       = ["208.80.154.224/32"]
}
```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Advanced


```hcl
resource "google_network_security_address_group" "default" {
  name        = "my-address-groups"
  parent      = "projects/my-project-name"
  location    = "us-central1"
  description = "my description"
  type        = "IPV4"
  capacity    = "100"
  items       = ["208.80.154.224/32"]
}
```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Cloud Armor


```hcl

  name        = "my-address-groups"
  parent      = "projects/my-project-name"
  location    = "global"
  type        = "IPV4"
  capacity    = "100"
  purpose     = ["CLOUD_ARMOR"]
  items       = ["208.80.154.224/32"]
}

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AddressGroup using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/addressGroups/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_security_address_group.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), AddressGroup can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_security_address_group.default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/addressGroups/{{name}}
