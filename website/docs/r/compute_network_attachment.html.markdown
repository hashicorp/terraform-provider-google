# google_compute_network_attachment

A network attachment is a resource that lets a producer Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network initiate connections to a consumer VPC network through a Private Service Connect interface.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about NetworkAttachment, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networkAttachments)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/about-network-attachments)

## Example Usage - Network Attachment Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network_attachment" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name = "basic-network-attachment"
    region = "us-central1"
    description = "basic network attachment description"
    connection_preference = "ACCEPT_MANUAL"

    subnetworks = [
        google_compute_subnetwork.default.self_link
    ]

    producer_accept_lists = [
        google_project.accepted_producer_project.project_id
    ]

    producer_reject_lists = [
        google_project.rejected_producer_project.project_id

resource "google_compute_network" "default" {
    provider = google-beta

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name = "basic-subnetwork"
    region = "us-central1"

    network = google_compute_network.default.id
    ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "google_project" "rejected_producer_project" {
    provider = google-beta
    project_id      = "prj-rejected"
    name            = "prj-rejected"
    org_id          = "123456789"
    billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
}

resource "google_project" "accepted_producer_project" {
    provider = google-beta
    project_id      = "prj-accepted"
    name            = "prj-accepted"
    org_id          = "123456789"
    billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
}

## Example Usage - Network Attachment Instance Usage


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name = "basic-network"
    auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name   = "basic-subnetwork"
    region = "us-central1"

    network       = google_compute_network.default.id
    ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "google_compute_network_attachment" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name   = "basic-network-attachment"
    region = "us-central1"
    description = "my basic network attachment"

    subnetworks = [google_compute_subnetwork.default.id]
    connection_preference = "ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC"
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
    provider = google-beta
    name         = "basic-instance"
    zone         = "us-central1-a"
    machine_type = "e2-micro"

    boot_disk {
        initialize_params {
            image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
        }
    }

    network_interface {
		network = "default"
	}

    network_interface {
        network_attachment = google_compute_network_attachment.default.self_link
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `connection_preference` -
  (Required)
  The connection preference of service attachment. The value can be set to ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC. An ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC service attachment is one that always accepts the connection from consumer forwarding rules.
  Possible values are: `ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC`, `ACCEPT_MANUAL`, `INVALID`.

* `subnetworks` -
  (Required)
  An array of URLs where each entry is the URL of a subnet provided by the service consumer to use for endpoints in the producers that connect to this network attachment.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `region` -
  (Required)
  URL of the region where the network attachment resides. This field applies only to the region resource. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `producer_reject_lists` -
  (Optional)
  Projects that are not allowed to connect to this network attachment. The project can be specified using its id or number.

* `producer_accept_lists` -
  (Optional)
  Projects that are allowed to connect to this network attachment. The project can be specified using its id or number.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}`

* `kind` -
  Type of the resource.

* `id` -
  The unique identifier for the resource type. The server generates this identifier.

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `self_link` -
  Server-defined URL for the resource.

* `self_link_with_id` -
  Server-defined URL for this resource's resource id.

* `connection_endpoints` -
  An array of connections for all the producers connected to this network attachment.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_connection_endpoints).

* `fingerprint` -
  Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This
  field is used in optimistic locking. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to patch.

* `network` -
  The URL of the network which the Network Attachment belongs to. Practically it is inferred by fetching the network of the first subnetwork associated.
  Because it is required that all the subnetworks must be from the same network, it is assured that the Network Attachment belongs to the same network as all the subnetworks.


<a name="nested_connection_endpoints"></a>The `connection_endpoints` block contains:

* `status` -
  (Output)
  The status of a connected endpoint to this network attachment.

* `project_id_or_num` -
  (Output)
  The project id or number of the interface to which the IP was assigned.

* `subnetwork` -
  (Output)
  The subnetwork used to assign the IP to the producer instance network interface.

* `ip_address` -
  (Output)
  The IPv4 address assigned to the producer instance network interface. This value will be a range in case of Serverless.

* `secondary_ip_cidr_ranges` -
  (Output)
  Alias IP ranges from the same subnetwork.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


NetworkAttachment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
* `{{region}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import NetworkAttachment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}"
  to = google_compute_network_attachment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), NetworkAttachment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_network_attachment.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/networkAttachments/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network_attachment.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network_attachment.default {{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network_attachment.default {{name}}
```
