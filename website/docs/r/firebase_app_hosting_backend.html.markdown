# google_firebase_app_hosting_backend

A Backend is the primary resource of App Hosting.



## Example Usage - Firebase App Hosting Backend Minimal


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_app_hosting_backend" "example" {
  project          = "my-project-name"
  # Choose the region closest to your users

  location         = "us-central1"
  backend_id       = "mini"
  app_id           = "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd"
  serving_locality = "GLOBAL_ACCESS"
  service_account  = google_service_account.service_account.email

  depends_on = [google_project_service.fah]
}

### Include these blocks only once per project if you are starting from scratch ###
resource "google_service_account" "service_account" {
  project = "my-project-name"

  # Must be firebase-app-hosting-compute
  account_id                   = "firebase-app-hosting-compute"
  display_name                 = "Firebase App Hosting compute service account"

  # Do not throw if already exists
  create_ignore_already_exists = true
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "app_hosting_sa_runner" {
  project = "my-project-name"

  # For App Hosting
  role   = "roles/firebaseapphosting.computeRunner"
  member = google_service_account.service_account.member

## Import


Backend can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backend_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backend using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend_id}}"
  to = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Backend can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.default {{location}}/{{backend_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
