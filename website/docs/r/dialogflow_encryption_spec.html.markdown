## Example Usage - Dialogflow Encryption Spec Basic


```hcl
resource "google_project" "project" {
  provider        = google-beta
  project_id      = "my-proj"
  name            = "my-proj"
  org_id          = "123456789"
  billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
  deletion_policy = "DELETE"
}

  purpose  = "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
}

  crypto_key_id = google_kms_crypto_key.key.id
  member        = "${replace(google_project_service_identity.gcp_sa.member, "@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam", "@gcp-sa-ccai-cmek.iam")}"
  role          = "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"
  depends_on    = [time_sleep.wait_create_sa]
}

resource "google_dialogflow_encryption_spec" "my-encryption-spec" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = google_project.project.project_id
  location = "us-central1"
  encryption_spec {
    kms_key = google_kms_crypto_key.key.id
  }
  depends_on = [google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member.crypto_key]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `encryption_spec` -
  (Required)
  A nested object resource.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_encryption_spec).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location in which the encryptionSpec is to be initialized.


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_encryption_spec"></a>The `encryption_spec` block supports:

* `kms_key` -
  (Required)
  The name of customer-managed encryption key that is used to secure a resource and its sub-resources.
  If empty, the resource is secured by the default Google encryption key.
  Only the key in the same location as this resource is allowed to be used for encryption.
  Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{key}

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/encryptionSpec/{{name}}`
