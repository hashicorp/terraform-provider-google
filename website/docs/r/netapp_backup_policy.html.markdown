# google\_netapp\_backup\_policy

A backup policy is used to schedule backups at regular daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.
Backup policies allow you to attach a backup schedule to a volume.
The policy defines how many backups to retain at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.


To get more information about backupPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/netapp/volumes/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.backupPolicies)
* How-to Guides

## Import


backupPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPolicies/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import backupPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPolicies/{{name}}"
  to = google_netapp_backup_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), backupPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_netapp_backup_policy.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPolicies/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_netapp_backup_policy.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_netapp_backup_policy.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
