# google\_data\_loss\_prevention\_stored\_info\_type

Allows creation of custom info types.


To get more information about StoredInfoType, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.storedInfoTypes)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-stored-infotypes)

## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Basic


```hcl
resource "google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type" "basic" {
	parent = "projects/my-project-name"
	description = "Description"
	display_name = "Displayname"

	regex {
		pattern = "patient"
		group_indexes = [2]
	}
}
```
## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Dictionary


```hcl
resource "google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type" "dictionary" {
	parent = "projects/my-project-name"
	description = "Description"
	display_name = "Displayname"

	dictionary {
		word_list {
			words = ["word", "word2"]
		}
	}
}
```
## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Large Custom Dictionary


```hcl
resource "google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type" "large" {
	parent = "projects/my-project-name"
	description = "Description"
	display_name = "Displayname"

	large_custom_dictionary {
		cloud_storage_file_set {
			url = "gs://${google_storage_bucket.bucket.name}/${google_storage_bucket_object.object.name}"
		}
		output_path {
			path = "gs://${google_storage_bucket.bucket.name}/output/dictionary.txt"
		}
	}
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name          = "tf-test-bucket"
  location      = "US"
  force_destroy = true
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "object" {
  name   = "tf-test-object"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source = "./test-fixtures/words.txt"
}
```
## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type With Id


```hcl
resource "google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type" "with_stored_info_type_id" {
  parent = "projects/my-project-name"
  description = "Description"
  display_name = "Displayname"
  stored_info_type_id = "id-"

  regex {
    pattern = "patient"
    group_indexes = [2]
  }
}
```

  (Optional)
  The storedInfoType ID can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens;
  that is, it must match the regular expression: [a-zA-Z\d-_]+. The maximum length is 100
  characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one.

  (Optional)
  Regular expression which defines the rule.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_regex).

* `dictionary` -
  (Optional)
  Dictionary which defines the rule.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_dictionary).

* `large_custom_dictionary` -
  (Optional)
  Dictionary which defines the rule.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_large_custom_dictionary).


<a name="nested_regex"></a>The `regex` block supports:

* `pattern` -
  (Required)
  Pattern defining the regular expression.
  Its syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.

* `group_indexes` -
  (Optional)
  The index of the submatch to extract as findings. When not specified, the entire match is returned. No more than 3 may be included.

## Import


StoredInfoType can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/storedInfoTypes/{{name}}`
* `{{parent}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import StoredInfoType using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/storedInfoTypes/{{name}}"
  to = google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), StoredInfoType can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type.default {{parent}}/storedInfoTypes/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_data_loss_prevention_stored_info_type.default {{parent}}/{{name}}
```
