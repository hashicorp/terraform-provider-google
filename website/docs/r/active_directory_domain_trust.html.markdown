* How-to Guides
    * [Active Directory Trust](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/docs/create-one-way-trust)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including `trust_handshake_secret` will be stored in the raw

## Example Usage - Active Directory Domain Trust Basic


```hcl
resource "google_active_directory_domain_trust" "ad-domain-trust" {
    domain     = "test-managed-ad.com"
    target_domain_name = "example-gcp.com"
    target_dns_ip_addresses = ["10.1.0.100"]
    trust_direction         = "OUTBOUND"
    trust_type              = "FOREST"
    trust_handshake_secret  = "Testing1!"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `target_domain_name` -
  (Required)
  The fully qualified target domain name which will be in trust with the current domain.

* `trust_type` -
  (Required)

  Possible values are `FOREST` and `EXTERNAL`.

* `trust_direction` -
  (Required)
  The trust direction, which decides if the current domain is trusted, trusting, or both.
  Possible values are `INBOUND`, `OUTBOUND`, and `BIDIRECTIONAL`.

  (Required)
  The target DNS server IP addresses which can resolve the remote domain involved in the trust.

  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `domain` -
  (Required)
  The fully qualified domain name. e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the restrictions, 
  https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.domains.
