# google_project_service

Allows management of a single API service for a Google Cloud project. 

For a list of services available, visit the [API library page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
or run `gcloud services list --available`.

This resource requires the [Service Usage API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/serviceusage.googleapis.com)
to use.

To get more information about `google_project_service`, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/reference/rest/v1/services)
* How-to Guides
    * [Enabling and Disabling Services](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable)
* Terraform guidance
    * [User Guide - google_project_service](/docs/providers/google/guides/google_project_service.html)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_project_service" "project" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  service = "iam.googleapis.com"

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "40m"
  }

  disable_on_destroy = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service` - (Required) The service to enable.

* `project` - (Optional) The project ID. If not provided, the provider project
is used.

* `disable_on_destroy` - (Optional) If `true` or unset, disable the service when the
Terraform resource is destroyed. If `false`, the service will be left enabled when
the Terraform resource is destroyed. Defaults to `true`. Most configurations should
set this to `false`; it should generally only be `true` or unset in configurations
that manage the `google_project` resource itself.

* `disable_dependent_services` - (Optional) If `true`, services that are enabled
and which depend on this service should also be disabled when this service is
destroyed. If `false` or unset, an error will be returned if any enabled
services depend on this service when attempting to destroy it.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{project}}/{{service}}`

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `read`   - Default is 10 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import

Project services can be imported using the `project_id` and `service`, e.g.

* `{{project_id}}/{{service}}`

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import project services using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{project_id}}/{{service}}"
  to = google_project_service.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), project services can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_project_service.default {{project_id}}/{{service}}
```

Note that unlike other resources that fail if they already exist,
`terraform apply` can be successfully used to verify already enabled services.
This means that when importing existing resources into Terraform, you can either
import the `google_project_service` resources or treat them as new
infrastructure and run `terraform apply` to add them to state.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
