# google\_org\_policy\_custom\_constraint

Custom constraints are created by administrators to provide more granular and customizable control over the specific fields that are restricted by your organization policies.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about CustomConstraint, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/reference/orgpolicy/rest/v2/organizations.constraints)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-custom-constraints)
    * [Supported Services](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/custom-constraint-supported-services)

## Example Usage - Org Policy Custom Constraint Basic


```hcl
resource "google_org_policy_custom_constraint" "constraint" {
  provider = google-beta

  name         = "custom.disableGkeAutoUpgrade"
  parent       = "organizations/123456789"

  action_type    = "ALLOW"
  condition      = "resource.management.autoUpgrade == false"
  method_types   = ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
  resource_types = ["container.googleapis.com/NodePool"]
}
```
## Example Usage - Org Policy Custom Constraint Full


```hcl
resource "google_org_policy_custom_constraint" "constraint" {
  provider = google-beta

  name         = "custom.disableGkeAutoUpgrade"
  parent       = "organizations/123456789"
  display_name = "Disable GKE auto upgrade"
  description  = "Only allow GKE NodePool resource to be created or updated if AutoUpgrade is not enabled where this custom constraint is enforced."

  action_type    = "ALLOW"
  condition      = "resource.management.autoUpgrade == false"
  method_types   = ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
  resource_types = ["container.googleapis.com/NodePool"]
}

resource "google_org_policy_policy" "bool" {
  provider = google-beta

  name   = "organizations/123456789/policies/${google_org_policy_custom_constraint.constraint.name}"
  parent = "organizations/123456789"

  spec {
    rules {
      enforce = "TRUE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The name of the custom constraint. This is unique within the organization.

* `condition` -
  (Required)
  A CEL condition that refers to a supported service resource, for example `resource.management.autoUpgrade == false`. For details about CEL usage, see [Common Expression Language](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-custom-constraints#common_expression_language).

* `action_type` -
  (Required)
  The action to take if the condition is met.
  Possible values are `ALLOW` and `DENY`.

* `method_types` -
  (Required)
  A list of RESTful methods for which to enforce the constraint. Can be `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or both. Not all Google Cloud services support both methods. To see supported methods for each service, find the service in [Supported services](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/custom-constraint-supported-services).

* `resource_types` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The fully qualified name of the Google Cloud REST resource containing the object and field you want to restrict. For example, `container.googleapis.com/NodePool`.

* `parent` -
  (Required)
  The parent of the resource, an organization. Format should be `organizations/{organization_id}`.


- - -


* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  A human-friendly name for the constraint.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-friendly description of the constraint to display as an error message when the policy is violated.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{parent}}/customConstraints/{{name}}`

* `update_time` -
  Output only. The timestamp representing when the constraint was last updated.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.
