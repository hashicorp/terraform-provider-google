## Import


Connection can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{connection_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{connection_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Connection using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}"
  to = google_developer_connect_connection.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Connection can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_developer_connect_connection.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/connections/{{connection_id}}
$ terraform import google_developer_connect_connection.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{connection_id}}
$ terraform import google_developer_connect_connection.default {{location}}/{{connection_id}}
```
