  Apigee NAT (network address translation) address.

# google\_apigee\_nat\_address

Apigee NAT (network address translation) address. A NAT address is a static external IP address used for Internet egress traffic. This is not avaible for Apigee hybrid.
Apigee NAT addresses are not automatically activated because they might require explicit allow entries on the target systems first. See https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.instances.natAddresses/activate


To get more information about NatAddress, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.instances.natAddresses)
* How-to Guides
    * [Provisioning NAT IPs](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/security/nat-provisioning)

## Example Usage - Apigee Nat Address Basic


```hcl
data "google_client_config" "current" {}

resource "google_compute_network" "apigee_network" {
  name       = "apigee-network"
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "apigee_range" {
  name          = "apigee-range"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "apigee_vpc_connection" {
  network                 = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.apigee_range.name]
}

resource "google_apigee_organization" "apigee_org" {
  analytics_region   = "us-central1"
  project_id         = google_project.project.project_id
  authorized_network = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
}

resource "google_apigee_instance" "apigee_instance" {
  name     = "tf-test%{random_suffix}"
  location = "us-central1-b"
  org_id   = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.id
}

resource "google_apigee_nat_address" "apigee_nat_addres" {
  instance_id  = google_apigee_instance.apigee_instance.id
  name  = "nat-address"
}
```

## Argument Reference
