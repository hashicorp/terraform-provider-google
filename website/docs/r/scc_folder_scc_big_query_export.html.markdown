# google_scc_folder_scc_big_query_export

A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) Big Query Export Config.
It represents exporting Security Command Center data, including assets, findings, and security marks
to a BigQuery instance.

-> **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v1/folders.bigQueryExports)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-analyze-findings-in-big-query)

## Example Usage - Scc Folder Big Query Export Config Basic


```hcl
resource "google_folder" "folder" {
  parent       = "organizations/123456789"
  display_name = "folder-name"

  deletion_protection = false
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "default" {
  dataset_id                  = "my_dataset_id"
  friendly_name               = "test"
  description                 = "This is a test description"
  location                    = "US"
  default_table_expiration_ms = 3600000
  default_partition_expiration_ms = null

  labels = {
    env = "default"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [default_partition_expiration_ms]
  }
}

resource "google_scc_folder_scc_big_query_export" "custom_big_query_export_config" {
  big_query_export_id    = "my-export"
  folder       = google_folder.folder.folder_id
  dataset      = google_bigquery_dataset.default.id
  description  = "Cloud Security Command Center Findings Big Query Export Config"
  filter       = "state=\"ACTIVE\" AND NOT mute=\"MUTED\""
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `description` -
  (Required)
  The description of the export (max of 1024 characters).

* `dataset` -
  (Required)
  The dataset to write findings' updates to.
  Its format is "projects/[projectId]/datasets/[bigquery_dataset_id]".
  BigQuery Dataset unique ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_).

* `filter` -
  (Required)
  Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
  events of findings. The
  expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
  logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
  has higher precedence than AND.
  Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
  a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
  map to those defined in the corresponding resource.
  The supported operators are:
  * = for all value types.
  * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
  * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
  The supported value types are:
  * string literals in quotes.
  * integer literals without quotes.
  * boolean literals true and false without quotes.
  See
  [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications)
  for information on how to write a filter.

* `folder` -
  (Required)
  The folder where Cloud Security Command Center Big Query Export
  Config lives in.

* `big_query_export_id` -
  (Required)
  This must be unique within the organization.
