# google_clouddomains_registration

Registers a new domain name and creates a corresponding Registration resource.


To get more information about Registration, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.registrations)
* How-to Guides
    * [Register a domain with Cloud Domains](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/buy-register-domain)

~> **Warning:** The Terraform implementation of this resource will not actually delete a Registration during
`terraform destroy`. Instead it will "abandon" the resource and remove it from state.
For information on deleting a registered domain, see https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/delete-domain

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `yearly_price` -

  registrations.retrieveRegisterParameters or registrations.searchDomains calls.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_yearly_price).

  (Required)
  Required. Settings for contact information linked to the Registration.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_contact_settings).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource

* `domain_name` -
  (Required)
  Required. The domain name. Unicode domain names must be expressed in Punycode format.


<a name="nested_yearly_price"></a>The `yearly_price` block supports:

* `currency_code` -
  (Optional)
  The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217.

* `units` -
  (Optional)
  The whole units of the amount. For example if currencyCode is "USD", then 1 unit is one US dollar.

<a name="nested_contact_settings"></a>The `contact_settings` block supports:

* `privacy` -
  (Required)
  Required. Privacy setting for the contacts associated with the Registration.
  Values are PUBLIC_CONTACT_DATA, PRIVATE_CONTACT_DATA, and REDACTED_CONTACT_DATA

* `registrant_contact` -
  (Required)
  Caution: Anyone with access to this email address, phone number, and/or postal address can take control of the domain.
  Warning: For new Registrations, the registrant receives an email confirmation that they must complete within 15 days to
  avoid domain suspension.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_registrant_contact).

* `admin_contact` -
  (Required)
  Caution: Anyone with access to this email address, phone number, and/or postal address can take control of the domain.
  Warning: For new Registrations, the registrant receives an email confirmation that they must complete within 15 days to
  avoid domain suspension.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_admin_contact).

* `technical_contact` -
  (Required)
  Caution: Anyone with access to this email address, phone number, and/or postal address can take control of the domain.
  Warning: For new Registrations, the registrant receives an email confirmation that they must complete within 15 days to
  avoid domain suspension.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_technical_contact).


<a name="nested_registrant_contact"></a>The `registrant_contact` block supports:

* `email` -
  (Required)
  Required. Email address of the contact.

* `phone_number` -
  (Required)
  Required. Phone number of the contact in international format. For example, "+1-800-555-0123".

* `fax_number` -
  (Optional)
  Fax number of the contact in international format. For example, "+1-800-555-0123".

* `postal_address` -
  (Required)
  Required. Postal address of the contact.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_postal_address).


<a name="nested_postal_address"></a>The `postal_address` block supports:

* `region_code` -
  (Required)
  Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to
  ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and
  https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: "CH" for Switzerland.

* `postal_code` -
  (Optional)
  Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used,
  they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).

* `administrative_area` -
  (Optional)
  Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state,
  a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community
  (e.g. "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland
  this should be left unpopulated.

* `locality` -
  (Optional)
  Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world
  where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use addressLines.

* `organization` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the organization at the address.

* `address_lines` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.
  Because values in addressLines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single
  field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be
  "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language
  is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way,
  the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language.

* `recipients` -
  (Optional)
  The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example,
  it might contain "care of" information.

<a name="nested_admin_contact"></a>The `admin_contact` block supports:

* `email` -
  (Required)
  Required. Email address of the contact.

* `phone_number` -
  (Required)
  Required. Phone number of the contact in international format. For example, "+1-800-555-0123".

* `fax_number` -
  (Optional)
  Fax number of the contact in international format. For example, "+1-800-555-0123".

* `postal_address` -
  (Required)

```
$ terraform import google_clouddomains_registration.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/registrations/{{domain_name}}
$ terraform import google_clouddomains_registration.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{domain_name}}
