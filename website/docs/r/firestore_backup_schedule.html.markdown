# google_firestore_backup_schedule

A backup schedule for a Cloud Firestore Database.
This resource is owned by the database it is backing up, and is deleted along with the database.
The actual backups are not though.


To get more information about BackupSchedule, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases.backupSchedules)

a Firestore database.
This resource is owned by the database it is backing up, and is deleted along
with the database. The actual backups are not though.

## Example Usage - Firestore Backup Schedule Daily


```hcl
resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {
  project     = "my-project-name"
  name        = "database-id"
  location_id = "nam5"
  type        = "FIRESTORE_NATIVE"

  delete_protection_state = "DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLED"
  deletion_policy         = "DELETE"
}

resource "google_firestore_backup_schedule" "daily-backup" {
  project  = "my-project-name"
  database = google_firestore_database.database.name

  retention = "8467200s" // 14 weeks (maximum possible retention)

  daily_recurrence {}
}
```
## Example Usage - Firestore Backup Schedule Weekly


```hcl
resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {

  type        = "FIRESTORE_NATIVE"

  delete_protection_state = "DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLED"
  deletion_policy         = "DELETE"
}

resource "google_firestore_backup_schedule" "weekly-backup" {
  project  = "my-project-name"
  database = google_firestore_database.database.name

  retention = "8467200s" // 14 weeks (maximum possible retention)
