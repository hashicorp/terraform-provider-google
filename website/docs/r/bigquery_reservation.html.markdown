## Example Usage - Bigquery Reservation Basic


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_reservation" "reservation" {
	name           = "my-reservation"
	location       = "us-west2"
	// Set to 0 for testing purposes
	// In reality this would be larger than zero
	slot_capacity     = 0
	edition = "STANDARD"
	ignore_idle_slots = true
	concurrency       = 0
	autoscale {
   	  max_slots = 100
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `slot_capacity` -
  (Required)
  Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
  unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the reservation. This field must only contain alphanumeric characters or dash.


* `ignore_idle_slots` -
  (Optional)
  If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
  the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
  capacity specified above at most.

* `concurrency` -
  (Optional)
  Maximum number of queries that are allowed to run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft limit due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency will be automatically set based on the reservation size.

* `edition` -
  (Optional)
  The edition type. Valid values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS

* `autoscale` -
  (Optional)
  The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_autoscale).

* `secondary_location` -
  (Optional)
  The current location of the reservation's secondary replica. This field is only set for
  reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature. Users can set this in create
  reservation calls to create a failover reservation or in update reservation calls to convert
  a non-failover reservation to a failover reservation(or vice versa).

* `scaling_mode` -
  (Optional, [Beta](../guides/provider_versions.html.markdown))
  The scaling mode for the reservation. If the field is present but maxSlots is not present,
  requests will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  Enum values:
  `SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED`: Default value of ScalingMode.
  `AUTOSCALE_ONLY`: The reservation will scale up only using slots from autoscaling. It will
  not use any idle slots even if there may be some available. The upper limit that autoscaling
  can scale up to will be maxSlots - baseline. For example, if maxSlots is 1000, baseline is 200
  and customer sets ScalingMode to AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then autoscalerg will scale up to 800 slots
  and no idle slots will be used. Please note, in this mode, the ignoreIdleSlots field must be
  set to true. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code
  google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  `IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY`: The reservation will scale up using only idle slots contributed by other
  reservations or from unassigned commitments. If no idle slots are available it will not scale
  up further. If the idle slots which it is using are reclaimed by the contributing reservation(s)
  it may be forced to scale down. The max idle slots the reservation can be maxSlots - baseline
  capacity. For example, if maxSlots is 1000, baseline is 200 and customer sets ScalingMode to
  IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, 1. if there are 1000 idle slots available in other reservations, the
  reservation will scale up to 1000 slots with 200 baseline and 800 idle slots. 2. if there are
  500 idle slots available in other reservations, the reservation will scale up to 700 slots with
  200 baseline and 300 idle slots. Please note, in this mode, the reservation might not be able to
  scale up to maxSlots. Please note, in this mode, the ignoreIdleSlots field must be set to false.
  Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT
  `ALL_SLOTS`: The reservation will scale up using all slots available to it. It will use idle slots
  contributed by other reservations or from unassigned commitments first. If no idle slots are
  available it will scale up using autoscaling. For example, if maxSlots is 1000, baseline is 200
  and customer sets ScalingMode to ALL_SLOTS, 1. if there are 800 idle slots available in other
  reservations, the reservation will scale up to 1000 slots with 200 baseline and 800 idle slots. 2.
  if there are 500 idle slots available in other reservations, the reservation will scale up to 1000
  slots with 200 baseline, 500 idle slots and 300 autoscaling slots. 3. if there are no idle slots
  available in other reservations, it will scale up to 1000 slots with 200 baseline and 800
  autoscaling slots. Please note, in this mode, the ignoreIdleSlots field must be set to false.
  Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  Possible values are: `SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED`, `AUTOSCALE_ONLY`, `IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY`, `ALL_SLOTS`.

* `max_slots` -
  (Optional, [Beta](../guides/provider_versions.html.markdown))
  The overall max slots for the reservation, covering slotCapacity (baseline), idle slots
  (if ignoreIdleSlots is false) and scaled slots. If present, the reservation won't use
  more than the specified number of slots, even if there is demand and supply (from idle
  slots). NOTE: capping a reservation's idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may
  exceed the maxSlots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts
  for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the maxSlots - baseline.
  This field must be set together with the scalingMode enum value, otherwise the request
  will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  If the maxSlots and scalingMode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field
  must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code
  google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT. However, the autoscale field may still be in the
  output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots
  will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example,
  if the maxSlots is 1000 and scalingMode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the
  autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value
  between 0 and 1000.
  If the maxSlots is 1000, scalingMode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots
  usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the
  autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700.
  If the maxSlots is 1000, scalingMode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the
  autoscaler field will be null.
  If the maxSlots and scalingMode are set, then the ignoreIdleSlots field must be
  aligned with the scalingMode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments).
  Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  Please note, the maxSlots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the
  baseline. Therefore, we don't allow users to set maxSlots smaller or equal to the
  baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and
  slotCapacity>=maxSlots, requests will be rejected with error code
  google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
  Please note that if maxSlots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set
  maxSlots to 0 and set scalingMode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the maxSlots
  feature.

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
  Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_autoscale"></a>The `autoscale` block supports:

* `current_slots` -
  (Output)
  The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots].

* `max_slots` -
  (Optional)
  Number of slots to be scaled when needed.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}`

* `primary_location` -
  The current location of the reservation's primary replica. This field is only set for
  reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature.

* `original_primary_location` -
  The location where the reservation was originally created. This is set only during the
  failover reservation's creation. All billing charges for the failover reservation will be
  applied to this location.

* `replication_status` -
  The Disaster Recovery(DR) replication status of the reservation. This is only available for
  the primary replicas of DR/failover reservations and provides information about the both the
  staleness of the secondary and the last error encountered while trying to replicate changes
  from the primary to the secondary. If this field is blank, it means that the reservation is
  either not a DR reservation or the reservation is a DR secondary or that any replication
  operations on the reservation have succeeded.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_status).


<a name="nested_replication_status"></a>The `replication_status` block contains:

* `error` -
  (Output)
  The last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the
  secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_status_error).

* `last_error_time` -
  (Output)
  The time at which the last error was encountered while trying to replicate changes from
  the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not
  succeeded since.

* `last_replication_time` -
  (Output)
  A timestamp corresponding to the last change on the primary that was successfully
  replicated to the secondary.


<a name="nested_replication_status_error"></a>The `error` block contains:

* `code` -
  (Output)
  The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rpc/google.rpc#google.rpc.Code).

* `message` -
  (Output)
  A developer-facing error message, which should be in English.
