A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee BigQuery slots to users.


To get more information about Reservation, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rest/v1/projects.locations.reservations/create)
* How-to Guides
    * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)

## Example Usage - Bigquery Reservation Basic


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_reservation" "reservation" {
	name           = "my-reservation"
	location       = "us-west2"
	// Set to 0 for testing purposes
	// In reality this would be larger than zero
	slot_capacity     = 0
	edition = "STANDARD"
	ignore_idle_slots = true
	concurrency       = 0
	autoscale {
   	  max_slots = 100
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `slot_capacity` -
  (Required)
  Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
  unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the reservation. This field must only contain alphanumeric characters or dash.


- - -


* `ignore_idle_slots` -
  (Optional)
  If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
  the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
  capacity specified above at most.

* `concurrency` -
  (Optional)
  Maximum number of queries that are allowed to run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft limit due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency will be automatically set based on the reservation size.

* `edition` -
  (Optional)
  The edition type. Valid values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS

* `autoscale` -
  (Optional)
  The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_autoscale).

* `secondary_location` -
  (Optional)
  The current location of the reservation's secondary replica. This field is only set for
  reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature. Users can set this in create
  reservation calls to create a failover reservation or in update reservation calls to convert
  a non-failover reservation to a failover reservation(or vice versa).

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
  Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_autoscale"></a>The `autoscale` block supports:

* `current_slots` -
  (Output)
  The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots].

* `max_slots` -
  (Optional)
  Number of slots to be scaled when needed.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}`

* `primary_location` -
  The current location of the reservation's primary replica. This field is only set for
  reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature.

* `original_primary_location` -
  The location where the reservation was originally created. This is set only during the
  failover reservation's creation. All billing charges for the failover reservation will be
  applied to this location.

* `replication_status` -
  The Disaster Recovery(DR) replication status of the reservation. This is only available for
  the primary replicas of DR/failover reservations and provides information about the both the
  staleness of the secondary and the last error encountered while trying to replicate changes
  from the primary to the secondary. If this field is blank, it means that the reservation is
  either not a DR reservation or the reservation is a DR secondary or that any replication
  operations on the reservation have succeeded.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_status).


<a name="nested_replication_status"></a>The `replication_status` block contains:

* `error` -
  (Output)
  The last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the
  secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_status_error).

* `last_error_time` -
  (Output)
  The time at which the last error was encountered while trying to replicate changes from
  the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not
  succeeded since.

* `last_replication_time` -
  (Output)
  A timestamp corresponding to the last change on the primary that was successfully
  replicated to the secondary.


<a name="nested_replication_status_error"></a>The `error` block contains:

* `code` -
  (Output)
  The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rpc/google.rpc#google.rpc.Code).

* `message` -
  (Output)
  A developer-facing error message, which should be in English.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Reservation using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}"
  to = google_bigquery_reservation.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Reservation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_bigquery_reservation.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/reservations/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_reservation.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_reservation.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
