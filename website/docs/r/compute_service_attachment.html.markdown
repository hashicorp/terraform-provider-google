# google\_compute\_service\_attachment

Represents a ServiceAttachment resource.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about ServiceAttachment, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/beta/serviceAttachments)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
  comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
  long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
  following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
  except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `connection_preference` -
  (Required)
  The connection preference to use for this service attachment. Valid
  values include "ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC", "ACCEPT_MANUAL".

* `target_service` -
  (Required)
  The URL of a forwarding rule that represents the service identified by
  this service attachment.

* `nat_subnets` -
  (Required)
  An array of subnets that is provided for NAT in this service attachment.

* `enable_proxy_protocol` -
  (Required)
  If true, enable the proxy protocol which is for supplying client TCP/IP
  address data in TCP connections that traverse proxies on their way to
  destination servers.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `consumer_reject_lists` -
  (Optional)
  An array of projects that are not allowed to connect to this service
  attachment.

* `consumer_accept_lists` -
  (Optional)
  An array of projects that are allowed to connect to this service
  attachment.
  Structure is documented below.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  URL of the region where the resource resides.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `consumer_accept_lists` block supports:

* `project_id_or_num` -
  (Required)
  A project that is allowed to connect to this service attachment.

* `connection_limit` -
  (Required)
  The number of consumer forwarding rules the consumer project can
  create.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/serviceAttachments/{{name}}`

* `connected_endpoints` -
  An array of the consumer forwarding rules connected to this service
  attachment.
  Structure is documented below.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


The `connected_endpoints` block contains:

* `endpoint` -
  The URL of the consumer forwarding rule.

* `status` -
  The status of the connection from the consumer forwarding rule to
  this service attachment.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.
