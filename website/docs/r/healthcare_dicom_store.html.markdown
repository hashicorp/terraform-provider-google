A DicomStore is a datastore inside a Healthcare dataset that conforms to the DICOM
(https://www.dicomstandard.org/about/) standard for Healthcare information exchange


To get more information about DicomStore, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.dicomStores)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a DICOM store](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicom)

## Example Usage - Healthcare Dicom Store Basic


```hcl
resource "google_healthcare_dicom_store" "default" {
  name    = "example-dicom-store"
  dataset = google_healthcare_dataset.dataset.id

  notification_config {
    pubsub_topic = google_pubsub_topic.topic.id
  }

  labels = {
    label1 = "labelvalue1"
  }
}

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "topic" {
  name     = "dicom-notifications"
}

resource "google_healthcare_dataset" "dataset" {
  name     = "example-dataset"
  location = "us-central1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name for the DicomStore.
  ** Changing this property may recreate the Dicom store (removing all data) **

* `dataset` -
  (Required)
  Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format
  'projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}'


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize DICOM stores.
  Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must
  conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}
  Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
  bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}
  No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
  Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

* `notification_config` -
  (Optional)
  A nested object resource
  Structure is documented below.


The `notification_config` block supports:

* `pubsub_topic` -
  (Required)
  The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
  PubsubMessage.Data will contain the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message.
  It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
  was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
  project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
  Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{dataset}}/dicomStores/{{name}}`

* `self_link` -
  The fully qualified name of this dataset


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import


DicomStore can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_healthcare_dicom_store.default {{dataset}}/dicomStores/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_healthcare_dicom_store.default {{dataset}}/{{name}}
```
