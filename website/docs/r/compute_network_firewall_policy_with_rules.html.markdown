## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  User-provided name of the Network firewall policy.
  The name should be unique in the project in which the firewall policy is created.
  The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically,
  the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?
  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
  lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `rule` -
  (Required)
  A list of firewall policy rules.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rule).


<a name="nested_rule"></a>The `rule` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A description of the rule.

* `rule_name` -
  (Optional)
  An optional name for the rule. This field is not a unique identifier
  and can be updated.

* `priority` -
  (Required)
  An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a value
  between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the
  highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.

* `match` -
  (Required)
  A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_match).

* `target_secure_tag` -
  (Optional)
  A list of secure tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
  applies to. If <code>targetSecureTag</code> are specified, then the
  firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one
  of those EFFECTIVE secure tags, if all the target_secure_tag are in
  INEFFECTIVE state, then this rule will be ignored.
  <code>targetSecureTag</code> may not be set at the same time as
  <code>targetServiceAccounts</code>.
  If neither <code>targetServiceAccounts</code> nor
  <code>targetSecureTag</code> are specified, the firewall rule applies
  to all instances on the specified network.
  Maximum number of target label tags allowed is 256.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target_secure_tag).

* `action` -
  (Required)
  The Action to perform when the client connection triggers the rule. Can currently be either
  "allow", "deny", "apply_security_profile_group" or "goto_next".

* `direction` -
  (Optional)
  The direction in which this rule applies. If unspecified an INGRESS rule is created.
  Possible values are: `INGRESS`, `EGRESS`.

* `enable_logging` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether to enable logging for a particular rule.
  If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to the
  configured export destination in Stackdriver.

* `target_service_accounts` -
  (Optional)
  A list of service accounts indicating the sets of
  instances that are applied with this rule.

* `security_profile_group` -
  (Optional)
  A fully-qualified URL of a SecurityProfile resource instance.
  Example:
  https://networksecurity.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/securityProfileGroups/my-security-profile-group
  Must be specified if action is 'apply_security_profile_group'.

* `tls_inspect` -
  (Optional)
  Boolean flag indicating if the traffic should be TLS decrypted.
  It can be set only if action = 'apply_security_profile_group' and cannot be set for other actions.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether the firewall policy rule is disabled. When set to true,
  the firewall policy rule is not enforced and traffic behaves as if it did
  not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall policy rule will be
  enabled.
