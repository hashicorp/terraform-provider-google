# google\_game\_services\_game\_server\_cluster

A game server cluster resource.


To get more information about GameServerCluster, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/game-servers/docs/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.realms.gameServerClusters)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/game-servers/docs)

## Example Usage - Game Service Cluster Basic


```hcl
resource "google_game_services_game_server_cluster" "default" {
    
  cluster_id = ""
  realm_id   = google_game_services_realm.default.realm_id

  connection_info {
    gke_cluster_reference {
      cluster = "locations/us-west1/clusters/%{agones_cluster}"
    }
    namespace = "default"
  }
}

resource "google_game_services_realm" "default" {
  realm_id   = "realm"
  time_zone  = "PST8PDT"

  description = "Test Game Realm"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `cluster_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. The resource name of the game server cluster

* `realm_id` -
  (Required)
  The realm id of the game server realm.

* `connection_info` -
  (Required)
  Game server cluster connection information. This information is used to
  manage game server clusters.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_connection_info).


<a name="nested_connection_info"></a>The `connection_info` block supports:

* `gke_cluster_reference` -
  (Required)
  Reference of the GKE cluster where the game servers are installed.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_gke_cluster_reference).

* `namespace` -
  (Required)
  Namespace designated on the game server cluster where the game server
  instances will be created. The namespace existence will be validated
  during creation.


<a name="nested_gke_cluster_reference"></a>The `gke_cluster_reference` block supports:

* `cluster` -
  (Required)
  The full or partial name of a GKE cluster, using one of the following
  forms:
  * `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster_id}`
  * `locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster_id}`
  * `{cluster_id}`
  If project and location are not specified, the project and location of the
  GameServerCluster resource are used to generate the full name of the
  GKE cluster.

- - -


* `location` -
  (Optional)
  Location of the Cluster.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  The labels associated with this game server cluster. Each label is a
  key-value pair.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Human readable description of the cluster.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/realms/{{realm_id}}/gameServerClusters/{{cluster_id}}`

* `name` -
  The resource id of the game server cluster, eg:
  `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/realms/{realm_id}/gameServerClusters/{cluster_id}`.
  For example,
  `projects/my-project/locations/{location}/realms/zanzibar/gameServerClusters/my-onprem-cluster`.
