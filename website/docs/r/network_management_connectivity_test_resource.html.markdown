## Example Usage - Network Management Connectivity Test Addresses


```hcl

  source {
      ip_address = google_compute_address.source-addr.address
      project_id = google_compute_address.source-addr.project
      network = google_compute_network.vpc.id
      network_type = "GCP_NETWORK"
  }

  destination {
      ip_address = google_compute_address.dest-addr.address
      project_id = google_compute_address.dest-addr.project
      network = google_compute_network.vpc.id
  }

  protocol = "UDP"
}

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc" {
  name = "connectivity-vpc"
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnet" {
  name          = "connectivity-vpc-subnet"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.id
}

resource "google_compute_address" "source-addr" {
  name         = "src-addr"
  subnetwork   = google_compute_subnetwork.subnet.id
  address_type = "INTERNAL"
  address      = "10.0.42.42"
  region       = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_compute_address" "dest-addr" {
  name         = "dest-addr"
  subnetwork   = google_compute_subnetwork.subnet.id
  address_type = "INTERNAL"
  address      = "10.0.43.43"
  region       = "us-central1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Unique name for the connectivity test.

* `source` -
  (Required)
  Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
  You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
  (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
  source location.
  Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
  a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
  also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
  which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
  information.
  If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
  you must provide the destination VPC network.
  If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
  network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
  identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
  address or VPC network.
  A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
  ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
  you don't intend to test.
  Structure is documented below.

* `destination` -
  (Required)
  Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
  You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
  Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
  destination location.
  Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
  location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
  endpoint from route information.
  If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
  multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
  destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
  interface.
  A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
  is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
  don't intend to test.
  Structure is documented below.


The `source` block supports:

* `ip_address` -
  (Optional)
  The IP address of the endpoint, which can be an external or
  internal IP. An IPv6 address is only allowed when the test's
  destination is a global load balancer VIP.

* `port` -
  (Optional)
  The IP protocol port of the endpoint. Only applicable when
  protocol is TCP or UDP.

* `instance` -
  (Optional)
  A Compute Engine instance URI.

* `network` -
  (Optional)
  A Compute Engine network URI.

* `network_type` -
  (Optional)
  Type of the network where the endpoint is located.
  Possible values are `GCP_NETWORK` and `NON_GCP_NETWORK`.

* `project_id` -
  (Optional)
  Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be
  derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
  The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:
  1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is
     within a GCP project.
  2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address
     that you provide is from the service project. In this case,
     the network that the IP address resides in is defined in the
     host project.

The `destination` block supports:

* `ip_address` -
  (Optional)
  The IP address of the endpoint, which can be an external or
  internal IP. An IPv6 address is only allowed when the test's
  destination is a global load balancer VIP.

* `port` -
  (Optional)
  The IP protocol port of the endpoint. Only applicable when
  protocol is TCP or UDP.

* `instance` -
  (Optional)
  A Compute Engine instance URI.

* `network` -
  (Optional)
  A Compute Engine network URI.

* `project_id` -
  (Optional)
  Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be
  derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
  The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:
  1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is within
  a GCP project. 2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address
  that you provide is from the service project. In this case, the
  network that the IP address resides in is defined in the host
  project.

- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  The user-supplied description of the Connectivity Test.
  Maximum of 512 characters.

* `protocol` -
  (Optional)
  IP Protocol of the test. When not provided, "TCP" is assumed.

* `related_projects` -
  (Optional)
  Other projects that may be relevant for reachability analysis.
  This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
  boundaries.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
