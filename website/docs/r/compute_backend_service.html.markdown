# google\_compute\_backend\_service

A Backend Service defines a group of virtual machines that will serve
traffic for load balancing. This resource is a global backend service,
appropriate for external load balancing or self-managed internal load balancing.
For managed internal load balancing, use a regional backend service instead.

Currently self-managed internal load balancing is only available in beta.


To get more information about BackendService, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/backendServices)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/backend-service)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `health_checks` -
  (Required)
  The set of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck resource
  for health checking this BackendService. Currently at most one health
  check can be specified, and a health check is required.
  For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `affinity_cookie_ttl_sec` -
  (Optional)
  Lifetime of cookies in seconds if session_affinity is
  GENERATED_COOKIE. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts
  only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The
  maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.
  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this field is not used.

* `backend` -
  (Optional)
  The set of backends that serve this BackendService.  Structure is documented below.

* `cdn_policy` -
  (Optional)
  Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService.  Structure is documented below.

* `connection_draining_timeout_sec` -
  (Optional)
  Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
  connections, but still work to finish started).

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `enable_cdn` -
  (Optional)
  If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendService.

* `iap` -
  (Optional)
  Settings for enabling Cloud Identity Aware Proxy  Structure is documented below.

* `load_balancing_scheme` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates whether the backend service will be used with internal or
  external load balancing. A backend service created for one type of
  load balancing cannot be used with the other. Must be `EXTERNAL` or
  `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` for a global backend service. Defaults to `EXTERNAL`.

* `port_name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of backend port. The same name should appear in the instance
  groups referenced by this service. Required when the load balancing
  scheme is EXTERNAL.

* `protocol` -
  (Optional)
  The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
  Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, and SSL. The default is
  HTTP. **NOTE**: HTTP2 is only valid for beta HTTP/2 load balancer
  types and may result in errors if used with the GA API.

* `security_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The security policy associated with this backend service.

* `session_affinity` -
  (Optional)
  Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is
  not applicable if the protocol is UDP.

* `timeout_sec` -
  (Optional)
  How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
  failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `backend` block supports:

* `balancing_mode` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the balancing mode for this backend.
  For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is
  UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S))
  and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).

* `capacity_scaler` -
  (Optional)
  A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity
  (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
  Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
  of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
  setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
  0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.
  Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `group` -
  (Required)
  The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
  Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
  of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
  instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
  the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
  are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
  For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
  endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
  located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
  Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
  Network Endpoint Group backends.
  Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
  Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
  partial URL.

* `max_connections` -
  (Optional)
  The max number of simultaneous connections for the group. Can
  be used with either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes.
  For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or one
  of maxConnectionsPerInstance or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint,
  as appropriate for group type, must be set.

* `max_connections_per_instance` -
  (Optional)
  The max number of simultaneous connections that a single
  backend instance can handle. This is used to calculate the
  capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
  UTILIZATION balancing modes.
  For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or
  maxConnectionsPerInstance must be set.

* `max_connections_per_endpoint` -
  (Optional)
  The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend
  network endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the
  capacity of the group. Can be used in either CONNECTION or
  UTILIZATION balancing modes.
  For CONNECTION mode, either
  maxConnections or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint must be set.

* `max_rate` -
  (Optional)
  The max requests per second (RPS) of the group.
  Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
  but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one
  of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
  group type, must be set.

* `max_rate_per_instance` -
  (Optional)
  The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend
  instance can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
  the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
  either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.

* `max_rate_per_endpoint` -
  (Optional)
  The max requests per second (RPS) that a single backend network
  endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of
  the group. Can be used in either balancing mode. For RATE mode,
  either maxRate or maxRatePerEndpoint must be set.

* `max_utilization` -
  (Optional)
  Used when balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This ratio defines the
  CPU utilization target for the group. The default is 0.8. Valid
  range is [0.0, 1.0].

The `cdn_policy` block supports:

* `cache_key_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.  Structure is documented below.

* `signed_url_cache_max_age_sec` -
  (Optional)
  Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request
  will be considered fresh, defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this
  time period, the response will be revalidated before
  being served.
  When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
  internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
  "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
  existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
  responses will not be altered.


The `cache_key_policy` block supports:

* `include_host` -
  (Optional)
  If true requests to different hosts will be cached separately.

* `include_protocol` -
  (Optional)
  If true, http and https requests will be cached separately.

* `include_query_string` -
  (Optional)
  If true, include query string parameters in the cache key
  according to query_string_whitelist and
  query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
  string will be included.
  If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
  key entirely.

* `query_string_blacklist` -
  (Optional)
  Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys.
  All other parameters will be included. Either specify
  query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
  '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
  delimiters.

* `query_string_whitelist` -
  (Optional)
  Names of query string parameters to include in cache keys.
  All other parameters will be excluded. Either specify
  query_string_whitelist or query_string_blacklist, not both.
  '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as
  delimiters.

The `iap` block supports:

* `oauth2_client_id` -
  (Required)
  OAuth2 Client ID for IAP

* `oauth2_client_secret` -
