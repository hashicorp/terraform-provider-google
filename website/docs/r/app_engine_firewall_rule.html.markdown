* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/reference/rest/v1/apps.firewall.ingressRules)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/creating-firewalls#creating_firewall_rules)

## Example Usage - App Engine Firewall Rule Basic


```hcl
resource "google_project" "my_project" {
  name       = "tf-test-project"
  project_id = "ae-project"
  org_id     = "123456789"
}

resource "google_app_engine_application" "app" {
  project     = google_project.my_project.project_id
  location_id = "us-central"
}

resource "google_app_engine_firewall_rule" "rule" {
  project      = google_app_engine_application.app.project
  priority     = 1000
  action       = "ALLOW"
  source_range = "*"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `source_range` -
  (Required)
  IP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of requests that this rule applies to.

* `action` -
  (Required)
  The action to take if this rule matches.
  Possible values are `UNSPECIFIED_ACTION`, `ALLOW`, and `DENY`.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional string description of this rule.

* `priority` -
  (Optional)
  A positive integer that defines the order of rule evaluation.
  Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first.
  A default rule at priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and
  IPv6 traffic when no previous rule matches. Only the action of
  this rule can be modified by the user.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `apps/{{project}}/firewall/ingressRules/{{priority}}`
