  Manages a GKE NodePool resource.

# google\_container\_node\_pool

Manages a node pool in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster separately from
the cluster control plane. For more information see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/node-pools)
and [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters.nodePools).

### Example Usage - using a separately managed node pool (recommended)

```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = "my-gke-cluster"
  location = "us-central1"

  # We can't create a cluster with no node pool defined, but we want to only use
  # separately managed node pools. So we create the smallest possible default
  # node pool and immediately delete it.
  remove_default_node_pool = true
  initial_node_count       = 1
}

resource "google_container_node_pool" "primary_preemptible_nodes" {
  name       = "my-node-pool"
  location   = "us-central1"
  cluster    = google_container_cluster.primary.name
  node_count = 1

  node_config {
    preemptible  = true
    machine_type = "n1-standard-1"

    oauth_scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring",
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example Usage - 2 node pools, 1 separately managed + the default node pool

```hcl
resource "google_container_node_pool" "np" {
  name       = "my-node-pool"
  location   = "us-central1-a"
  cluster    = google_container_cluster.primary.name
  node_count = 3

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "20m"
  }
}

resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name               = "marcellus-wallace"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 3

  node_locations = [
    "us-central1-c",
  ]

  master_auth {
    username = ""
    password = ""

    client_certificate_config {
      issue_client_certificate = false
    }
  }

  node_config {
    oauth_scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring",
    ]

    metadata = {
      disable-legacy-endpoints = "true"
    }

    guest_accelerator {
      type  = "nvidia-tesla-k80"
      count = 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `cluster` - (Required) The cluster to create the node pool for. Cluster must be present in `location` provided for zonal clusters.

- - -

* `location` - (Optional) The location (region or zone) of the cluster.

- - -

* `autoscaling` - (Optional) Configuration required by cluster autoscaler to adjust
    the size of the node pool to the current cluster usage. Structure is documented below.

* `initial_node_count` - (Optional) The initial number of nodes for the pool. In
regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the number of nodes per zone. Changing
this will force recreation of the resource.

* `management` - (Optional) Node management configuration, wherein auto-repair and
    auto-upgrade is configured. Structure is documented below.

* `max_pods_per_node` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) The maximum number of pods per node in this node pool.
    Note that this does not work on node pools which are "route-based" - that is, node
    pools belonging to clusters that do not have IP Aliasing enabled.
    See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr)
    for more information.

* `node_locations` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
The list of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located. Nodes must
be in the region of their regional cluster or in the same region as their
cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If unspecified, the cluster-level
`node_locations` will be used.

-> Note: `node_locations` will not revert to the cluster's default set of zones
upon being unset. You must manually reconcile the list of zones with your
cluster.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the node pool. If left blank, Terraform will
    auto-generate a unique name.

* `node_config` - (Optional) The node configuration of the pool. See
    [google_container_cluster](container_cluster.html) for schema.

* `node_count` - (Optional) The number of nodes per instance group. This field can be used to
    update the number of nodes per instance group but should not be used alongside `autoscaling`.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which to create the node pool. If blank,
    the provider-configured project will be used.

* `version` - (Optional) The Kubernetes version for the nodes in this pool. Note that if this field
    and `auto_upgrade` are both specified, they will fight each other for what the node version should
    be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
    recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
    when fuzzy versions are used. See the `google_container_engine_versions` data source's
    `version_prefix` field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

The `autoscaling` block supports:

* `min_node_count` - (Required) Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >=0 and
    <= `max_node_count`.

* `max_node_count` - (Required) Maximum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >= min_node_count.

The `management` block supports:

* `auto_repair` - (Optional) Whether the nodes will be automatically repaired.

* `auto_upgrade` - (Optional) Whether the nodes will be automatically upgraded.

## Timeouts

`google_container_node_pool` provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - (Default `30 minutes`) Used for adding node pools
- `update` - (Default `10 minutes`) Used for updates to node pools
- `delete` - (Default `10 minutes`) Used for removing node pools.

## Import

Node pools can be imported using the `project`, `zone`, `cluster` and `name`. If
the project is omitted, the default provider value will be used. Examples:

```
$ terraform import google_container_node_pool.mainpool my-gcp-project/us-east1-a/my-cluster/main-pool

$ terraform import google_container_node_pool.mainpool us-east1-a/my-cluster/main-pool
```
