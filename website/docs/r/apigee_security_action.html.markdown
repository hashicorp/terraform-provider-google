# google_apigee_security_action

A SecurityAction is rule that can be enforced at an environment level.
The result is one of: - A denied API call - An explicitly allowed API call
- A flagged API call (HTTP headers added before the target receives it)
At least one condition is required to create a SecurityAction.


To get more information about SecurityAction, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.environments.securityActions/create)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating security actions](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-security/security-actions-api#create-security-actions)

## Example Usage - Apigee Security Action Basic

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `state` -
  (Required)
  Only an ENABLED SecurityAction is enforced. An ENABLED SecurityAction past its expiration time will not be enforced.
  Possible values are: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.

* `condition_config` -
  (Required)
  A valid SecurityAction must contain at least one condition.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_condition_config).

* `org_id` -
  (Required)
  The organization that this security action applies to.

* `env_id` -
  (Required)
  The Apigee environment that this security action applies to.

* `security_action_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID to use for the SecurityAction, which will become the final component of the action's resource name.
  This value should be 0-61 characters, and valid format is (^a-z?$).


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional user provided description of the SecurityAction.

* `api_proxies` -
  (Optional)
  If unset, this would apply to all proxies in the environment.
  If set, this action is enforced only if at least one proxy in the repeated
  list is deployed at the time of enforcement. If set, several restrictions are enforced on SecurityActions.
  There can be at most 100 enabled actions with proxies set in an env.
  Several other restrictions apply on conditions and are detailed later.

* `allow` -
  (Optional)
  Allow a request through if it matches this SecurityAction.

* `deny` -
  (Optional)
  Deny a request through if it matches this SecurityAction.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_deny).

* `flag` -
  (Optional)
  Flag a request through if it matches this SecurityAction.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_flag).

* `expire_time` -
  (Optional)
  The expiration for this SecurityAction.
  Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9
  fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted.
  Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30".

* `ttl` -
  (Optional)
  The TTL for this SecurityAction.
  A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: "3.5s".

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.

* `region_codes` -
  (Optional)
  A list of countries/region codes to act on, e.g. US. This follows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2.

## Import


SecurityAction can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `organizations/{{org_id}}/environments/{{env_id}}/securityActions/{{security_action_id}}`
* `{{org_id}}/{{env_id}}/{{security_action_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SecurityAction using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "organizations/{{org_id}}/environments/{{env_id}}/securityActions/{{security_action_id}}"
  to = google_apigee_security_action.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SecurityAction can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apigee_security_action.default organizations/{{org_id}}/environments/{{env_id}}/securityActions/{{security_action_id}}
$ terraform import google_apigee_security_action.default {{org_id}}/{{env_id}}/{{security_action_id}}
```
