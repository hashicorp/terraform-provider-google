# google\_compute\_network

Manages a VPC network or legacy network resource on GCP.


To get more information about Network, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networks)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)

## Example Usage - Network Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "vpc-network"
}
```
## Example Usage - Network Custom Mtu


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  project                 = "my-project-name"
  name                    = "vpc-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = true
  mtu                     = 1460
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. The resource must be
  recreated to modify this field.

* `auto_create_subnetworks` -
  (Optional)
  When set to `true`, the network is created in "auto subnet mode" and
  it will create a subnet for each region automatically across the
  `10.128.0.0/9` address range.
  When set to `false`, the network is created in "custom subnet mode" so
  the user can explicitly connect subnetwork resources.

* `routing_mode` -
  (Optional)
  The network-wide routing mode to use. If set to `REGIONAL`, this
  network's cloud routers will only advertise routes with subnetworks
  of this network in the same region as the router. If set to `GLOBAL`,
  this network's cloud routers will advertise routes with all
  subnetworks of this network, across regions.
  Possible values are `REGIONAL` and `GLOBAL`.

* `mtu` -
  (Optional)
  Maximum Transmission Unit in bytes. The minimum value for this field is 1460
  and the maximum value is 1500 bytes.

* `enable_ula_internal_ipv6` -
  (Optional)
  Enable ULA internal ipv6 on this network. Enabling this feature will assign 
  a /48 from google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20.

* `internal_ipv6_range` -
  (Optional)
  When enabling ula internal ipv6, caller optionally can specify the /48 range 
  they want from the google defined ULA prefix fd20::/20. The input must be a 
  valid /48 ULA IPv6 address and must be within the fd20::/20. Operation will 
  fail if the speficied /48 is already in used by another resource. 
  If the field is not speficied, then a /48 range will be randomly allocated from fd20::/20 and returned via this field.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `delete_default_routes_on_create` - (Optional) If set to `true`, default routes (`0.0.0.0/0`) will be deleted
immediately after network creation. Defaults to `false`.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{name}}`

* `gateway_ipv4` -
  The gateway address for default routing out of the network. This value
  is selected by GCP.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Network can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default {{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
