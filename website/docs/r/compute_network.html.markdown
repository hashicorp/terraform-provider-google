# google\_compute\_network

Manages a VPC network or legacy network resource on GCP.


To get more information about Network, see:

* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)

## Example Usage - Network Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "vpc-network"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. The resource must be
  recreated to modify this field.

* `auto_create_subnetworks` -
  (Optional)
  When set to `true`, the network is created in "auto subnet mode" and
  it will create a subnet for each region automatically across the
  `10.128.0.0/9` address range.
  When set to `false`, the network is created in "custom subnet mode" so
  the user can explicitly connect subnetwork resources.

* `routing_mode` -
  (Optional)
  The network-wide routing mode to use. If set to `REGIONAL`, this
  network's cloud routers will only advertise routes with subnetworks
  of this network in the same region as the router. If set to `GLOBAL`,
  this network's cloud routers will advertise routes with all
  subnetworks of this network, across regions.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `delete_default_routes_on_create` - (Optional) If set to `true`, default routes (`0.0.0.0/0`) will be deleted
immediately after network creation. Defaults to `false`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `gateway_ipv4` -
  The gateway address for default routing out of the network. This value
  is selected by GCP.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Network can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_network.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
