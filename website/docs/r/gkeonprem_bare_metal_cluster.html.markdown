* `uid` -
  The unique identifier of the Bare Metal User Cluster.

* `state` -
  The current state of this cluster.

* `endpoint` -
  The IP address name of Bare Metal User Cluster's API server.

* `local_name` -
  The object name of the Bare Metal Cluster custom resource on the
  associated admin cluster. This field is used to support conflicting
  names when enrolling existing clusters to the API. When used as a part of
  cluster enrollment, this field will differ from the ID in the resource
  name. For new clusters, this field will match the user provided cluster ID
