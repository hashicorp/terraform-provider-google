## Example Usage - Logging Log Scope Basic


```hcl
resource "google_logging_log_scope" "logging_log_scope" {
    parent         = "projects/my-project-name"
    location       = "global"
    name           = "projects/my-project-name/locations/global/logScopes/my-log-scope"
    resource_names = [
        "projects/my-project-name",
        "projects/my-project-name/locations/global/buckets/_Default/views/view1",
        "projects/my-project-name/locations/global/buckets/_Default/views/view2"
    ]
    description    = "A log scope configured with Terraform"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the log scope. For example: \`projects/my-project/locations/global/logScopes/my-log-scope\`

* `resource_names` -
  (Required)
  Names of one or more parent resources : *  \`projects/[PROJECT_ID]\` May alternatively be one or more views : * \`projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]\` A log scope can include a maximum of 50 projects and a maximum of 100 resources in total.


- - -


* `description` -

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/logScopes/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The creation timestamp of the log scopes.

* `update_time` -
  Output only. The last update timestamp of the log scopes.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


LogScope can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/logScopes/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import LogScope using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/logScopes/{{name}}"
  to = google_logging_log_scope.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), LogScope can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_logging_log_scope.default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/logScopes/{{name}}
```
