## Example Usage - Bigquery Row Access Policy Basic


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "example" {
  dataset_id = "dataset_id"
  location = "US"
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "example" {
  deletion_protection = false

  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.example.dataset_id
  table_id   = "table_id"
}

resource "google_bigquery_row_access_policy" "example" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.example.dataset_id
  table_id   = google_bigquery_table.example.table_id
  policy_id = "policy_id"

  filter_predicate = "nullable_field is not NULL"
  grantees = [
    "domain:google.com"
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `dataset_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the dataset containing this row access policy.

* `table_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the table containing this row access policy.

* `policy_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the row access policy. The ID must contain only
  letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum
  length is 256 characters.

* `filter_predicate` -
  (Required)
  A SQL boolean expression that represents the rows defined by this row
  access policy, similar to the boolean expression in a WHERE clause of a
  SELECT query on a table.
  References to other tables, routines, and temporary functions are not
  supported.
  Examples: region="EU"
  date_field = CAST('2019-9-27' as DATE)
  nullable_field is not NULL
  numeric_field BETWEEN 1.0 AND 5.0


* `grantees` -
  (Optional)
  Input only. The optional list of iam_member users or groups that specifies the initial
  members that the row-level access policy should be created with.
  grantees types:
  - "user:alice@example.com": An email address that represents a specific
  Google account.
  - "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com": An email
  address that represents a service account.
  - "group:admins@example.com": An email address that represents a Google
  group.
  - "domain:example.com":The Google Workspace domain (primary) that
  represents all the users of that domain.
  - "allAuthenticatedUsers": A special identifier that represents all service
  accounts and all users on the internet who have authenticated with a Google
  Account. This identifier includes accounts that aren't connected to a
  Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain, such as personal Gmail accounts.
  Users who aren't authenticated, such as anonymous visitors, aren't
  included.
  - "allUsers":A special identifier that represents anyone who is on
  the internet, including authenticated and unauthenticated users. Because
  BigQuery requires authentication before a user can access the service,
  allUsers includes only authenticated users.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}/tables/{{table_id}}/rowAccessPolicies/{{policy_id}}`

* `creation_time` -
  The time when this row access policy was created, in milliseconds since
  the epoch.

* `last_modified_time` -
  The time when this row access policy was last modified, in milliseconds
  since the epoch.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


RowAccessPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}/tables/{{table_id}}/rowAccessPolicies/{{policy_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{dataset_id}}/{{table_id}}/{{policy_id}}`
* `{{dataset_id}}/{{table_id}}/{{policy_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RowAccessPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}/tables/{{table_id}}/rowAccessPolicies/{{policy_id}}"
  to = google_bigquery_row_access_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), RowAccessPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_bigquery_row_access_policy.default projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}/tables/{{table_id}}/rowAccessPolicies/{{policy_id}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_row_access_policy.default {{project}}/{{dataset_id}}/{{table_id}}/{{policy_id}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_row_access_policy.default {{dataset_id}}/{{table_id}}/{{policy_id}}
```
