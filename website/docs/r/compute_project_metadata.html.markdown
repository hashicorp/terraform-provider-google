  Manages common instance metadata

# google\_compute\_project\_metadata

Authoritatively manages metadata common to all instances for a project in GCE. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/projects/setCommonInstanceMetadata).

~> **Note:**  This resource manages all project-level metadata including project-level ssh keys.
Keys unset in config but set on the server will be removed. If you want to manage only single
key/value pairs within the project metadata rather than the entire set, then use
[google_compute_project_metadata_item](compute_project_metadata_item.html).

## Example Usage

resource "google_compute_project_metadata" "default" {
  metadata {
    foo  = "bar"
    fizz = "buzz"
    "13" = "42"
  }
}
```
