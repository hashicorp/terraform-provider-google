# google\_compute\_snapshot

Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.

Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are
different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily
to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful
for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create
snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running
instances.

Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a
persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly
created a full image of the disk.


To get more information about Snapshot, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/snapshots)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including `snapshot_encryption_key.raw_key` and `source_disk_encryption_key.raw_key` will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Snapshot Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_snapshot" "snapshot" {
  name        = "my-snapshot"
  source_disk = google_compute_disk.persistent.id
  zone        = "us-central1-a"
  labels = {
    my_label = "value"
  }
  storage_locations = ["us-central1"]
}

data "google_compute_image" "debian" {
  family  = "debian-11"
  project = "debian-cloud"
}

resource "google_compute_disk" "persistent" {
  name  = "debian-disk"
  image = data.google_compute_image.debian.self_link
  size  = 10
  type  = "pd-ssd"
  zone  = "us-central1-a"
}
```

## Example Usage - Snapshot Chainname


```hcl
resource "google_compute_snapshot" "snapshot" {
  name        = "my-snapshot"
  source_disk = google_compute_disk.persistent.id
  zone        = "us-central1-a"
  chain_name  = "snapshot-chain"
  labels = {
    my_label = "value"
  }
  storage_locations = ["us-central1"]
}

data "google_compute_image" "debian" {
  family  = "debian-11"
  project = "debian-cloud"
}

resource "google_compute_disk" "persistent" {
  name  = "debian-disk"
  image = data.google_compute_image.debian.self_link
  size  = 10
  type  = "pd-ssd"
  zone  = "us-central1-a"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `source_disk` -
  (Required)
  A reference to the disk used to create this snapshot.


- - -


* `chain_name` -
  (Optional)
  Creates the new snapshot in the snapshot chain labeled with the 
  specified name. The chain name must be 1-63 characters long and 
  comply with RFC1035. This is an uncommon option only for advanced 
  service owners who needs to create separate snapshot chains, for 
  example, for chargeback tracking.  When you describe your snapshot 
  resource, this field is visible only if it has a non-empty value.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `storage_locations` -
  (Optional)
  Cloud Storage bucket storage location of the snapshot (regional or multi-regional).

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels to apply to this Snapshot.

* `zone` -
  (Optional)
  A reference to the zone where the disk is hosted.

* `snapshot_encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied encryption key.
  After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied key, you must
  provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For example, you
  must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the
  encrypted snapshot in a future request.
  Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
  the snapshot.
  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot,
  then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated
  key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_snapshot_encryption_key).

* `source_disk_encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
  if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
  key.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_source_disk_encryption_key).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_snapshot_encryption_key"></a>The `snapshot_encryption_key` block supports:

* `raw_key` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in
  RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `sha256` -
  The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied
  encryption key that protects this resource.

* `kms_key_self_link` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS.

* `kms_key_service_account` -
  (Optional)
  The service account used for the encryption request for the given KMS key.
  If absent, the Compute Engine Service Agent service account is used.

<a name="nested_source_disk_encryption_key"></a>The `source_disk_encryption_key` block supports:

* `raw_key` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in
  RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `kms_key_service_account` -
  (Optional)
  The service account used for the encryption request for the given KMS key.
  If absent, the Compute Engine Service Agent service account is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/snapshots/{{name}}`

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `snapshot_id` -
  The unique identifier for the resource.

* `disk_size_gb` -
  Size of the snapshot, specified in GB.

* `storage_bytes` -
  A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As snapshots share
  storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot
  creation/deletion.

* `licenses` -
  A list of public visible licenses that apply to this snapshot. This
  can be because the original image had licenses attached (such as a
  Windows image).  snapshotEncryptionKey nested object Encrypts the
  snapshot using a customer-supplied encryption key.

* `label_fingerprint` -
  The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource. Used
  internally during updates.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.

[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:
