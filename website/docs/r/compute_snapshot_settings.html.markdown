  Possible values are: `NEAREST_MULTI_REGION`, `LOCAL_REGION`, `SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS`.

* `locations` -

  When the policy is SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS, snapshots will be stored in the
  locations listed in this field. Keys are Cloud Storage bucket locations.
  Only one location can be specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_storage_location_locations).


<a name="nested_storage_location_locations"></a>The `locations` block supports:

* `location` - (Required) The identifier for this object. Format specified above.

* `name` -

## Import


SnapshotSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SnapshotSettings using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/"
  to = google_compute_snapshot_settings.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SnapshotSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

$ terraform import google_compute_snapshot_settings.default projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/
$ terraform import google_compute_snapshot_settings.default {{project}}
```
