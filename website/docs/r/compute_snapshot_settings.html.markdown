Updates your project's snapshot settings and sets a new default storage location for snapshots.


To get more information about SnapshotSettings, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/snapshotSettings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-settings#snapshot_settings_how_to_update)

## Example Usage - Snapshot Settings Specific Locations


```hcl
resource "google_compute_snapshot_settings" "tf-test-snapshot-settings" {
    storage_location {
        policy    = "SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS"
        locations {
            name     = "us-central1"
            location = "us-central1"
        }
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `storage_location` -
  (Required)
  Policy of which storage location is going to be resolved, and additional data
  that particularizes how the policy is going to be carried out
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_storage_location).


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_storage_location"></a>The `storage_location` block supports:

* `policy` -
  (Required)
  The chosen location policy
  Possible values are: `NEAREST_MULTI_REGION`, `LOCAL_REGION`, `SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS`.

* `locations` -
  (Optional)
  When the policy is SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS, snapshots will be stored in the
  locations listed in this field. Keys are Cloud Storage bucket locations.
  Only one location can be specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_storage_location_locations).


<a name="nested_storage_location_locations"></a>The `locations` block supports:

* `location` - (Required) The identifier for this object. Format specified above.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the location. It should be one of the Cloud Storage buckets.
  Only one location can be specified. (should match location)

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/{{name}}`


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


SnapshotSettings can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/`
* `{{project}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import SnapshotSettings using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_compute_snapshot_settings.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SnapshotSettings using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/"
  to = google_compute_snapshot_settings.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SnapshotSettings can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_snapshot_settings.default projects/{{project}}/global/snapshotSettings/
$ terraform import google_compute_snapshot_settings.default {{project}}
```
