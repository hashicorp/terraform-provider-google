  location             = "us-central1"
  name                 = "some-channel"
  crypto_key_name      = "some-key"
  third_party_provider = "projects/my-project-name/locations/us-central1/providers/datadog"
}
```

* `third_party_provider` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the event provider (e.g. Eventarc SaaS partner) associated with the channel. This provider will be granted permissions to publish events to the channel. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/providers/{provider_id}`.

* `crypto_key_name` -

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}`

## Import


Channel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Channel using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    name = "<-required value->"
    location = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_eventarc_channel.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Channel using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}"
  to = google_eventarc_channel.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Channel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_eventarc_channel.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/channels/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_eventarc_channel.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_eventarc_channel.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
