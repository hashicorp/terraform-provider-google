# google\_edgenetwork\_subnet

A Distributed Cloud Edge subnet, which provides L2 isolation within a network.


To get more information about Subnet, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/reference/network/rest/v1/projects.locations.zones.subnets)
* How-to Guides
    * [Create and manage subnetworks](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/subnetworks#api)

## Example Usage - Edgenetwork Subnet


```hcl

resource "google_edgenetwork_subnet" "example_subnet" {
  subnet_id   = "example-subnet"
  location    = "us-west1"
  zone        = ""
  description = "Example subnet."
  network     = google_edgenetwork_network.example_network.id
  ipv4_cidr   = ["4.4.4.1/24"]
  labels      = {
    "environment" : "dev"
  }
}

resource "google_edgenetwork_network" "example_network" {
  network_id  = "example-network"
  location    = "us-west1"
  zone        = ""
  description = "Example network."
  mtu         = 9000
}
```
## Example Usage - Edgenetwork Subnet With Vlan Id


```hcl

resource "google_edgenetwork_subnet" "example_subnet_with_vlan_id" {
  subnet_id   = "example-subnet-with-vlan-id"
  location    = "us-west1"
  zone        = ""
  description = "Example subnet with VLAN ID."
  network     = google_edgenetwork_network.example_network.id
  ipv6_cidr   = ["4444:4444:4444:4444::1/64"]
  vlan_id     = 44
  labels      = {
    "environment" : "dev"
  }
}

resource "google_edgenetwork_network" "example_network" {
  network_id  = "example-network"
  location    = "us-west1"
  zone        = ""
  description = "Example network."
  mtu         = 9000
}
```
