# google\_vmwareengine\_subnet

Subnet in a private cloud. A Private Cloud contains two types of subnets: `management` subnets (such as vMotion) that
are read-only,and `userDefined`, which can also be updated. This resource should be used to read and update `userDefined`
subnets. To read `management` subnets, please utilize the subnet data source.


To get more information about Subnet, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.privateClouds.subnets)

## Example Usage - Vmware Engine Subnet User Defined


```hcl
resource "google_vmwareengine_network" "subnet-nw" {
  name        = "pc-nw"
  location    = "global"
  type        = "STANDARD"
  description = "PC network description."
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_private_cloud" "subnet-pc" {
  location    = "us-west1-a"
  name        = "sample-pc"
  description = "Sample test PC."
  network_config {
    management_cidr       = "192.168.50.0/24"
    vmware_engine_network = google_vmwareengine_network.subnet-nw.id
  }

  management_cluster {
    cluster_id = "sample-mgmt-cluster"
    node_type_configs {
      node_type_id = "standard-72"
      node_count   = 3
    }
  }
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_subnet" "vmw-engine-subnet" {
  name = "service-1"
  parent =  google_vmwareengine_private_cloud.subnet-pc.id
  ip_cidr_range = "192.168.100.0/26"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `ip_cidr_range` -
  (Required)
  The IP address range of the subnet in CIDR format.

* `parent` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the private cloud to create a new subnet in.
  Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.
  For example: projects/my-project/locations/us-west1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the subnet. For userDefined subnets, this name should be in the format of "service-n",
  where n ranges from 1 to 5.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{parent}}/subnets/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Creation time of this resource.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and
  up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `update_time` -
  Last updated time of this resource.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine
  fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `gateway_ip` -
  The IP address of the gateway of this subnet. Must fall within the IP prefix defined above.

* `gateway_id` -
  The canonical identifier of the logical router that this subnet is attached to.

* `dhcp_address_ranges` -
  DHCP address ranges.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_dhcp_address_ranges).

* `type` -
  The type of the subnet.

* `standard_config` -
  Whether the NSX-T configuration in the backend follows the standard configuration supported by Google Cloud.
  If false, the subnet cannot be modified through Google Cloud, only through NSX-T directly.

* `state` -
  State of the subnet.

* `uid` -
  System-generated unique identifier for the resource.

* `vlan_id` -
  VLAN ID of the VLAN on which the subnet is configured.


<a name="nested_dhcp_address_ranges"></a>The `dhcp_address_ranges` block contains:

* `first_address` -
  (Output)
  The first IP address of the range.

* `last_address` -
  (Output)
  The last IP address of the range.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Subnet can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/subnets/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Subnet using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/subnets/{{name}}"
  to = google_vmwareengine_subnet.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Subnet can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_vmwareengine_subnet.default {{parent}}/subnets/{{name}}
```
