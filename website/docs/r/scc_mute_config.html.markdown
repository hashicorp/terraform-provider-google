# google\_scc\_mute\_config

Mute Findings is a volume management feature in Security Command Center
that lets you manually or programmatically hide irrelevant findings,
and create filters to automatically silence existing and future
findings based on criteria you specify.


To get more information about MuteConfig, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.muteConfigs)

## Example Usage - Scc Mute Config


```hcl
resource "google_scc_mute_config" "default" {
  mute_config_id = "my-config"
  parent         = "organizations/123456789"
  filter         = "category: \"OS_VULNERABILITY\""
  description    = "My Mute Config"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `filter` -
  (Required)
  An expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
  events of findings. While creating a filter string, be mindful of
  the scope in which the mute configuration is being created. E.g.,
  If a filter contains project = X but is created under the
  project = Y scope, it might not match any findings.

* `mute_config_id` -
  (Required)
  Unique identifier provided by the client within the parent scope.

* `parent` -
  (Required)
  Resource name of the new mute configs's parent. Its format is
  "organizations/[organization_id]", "folders/[folder_id]", or
  "projects/[project_id]".

* `name` -

  organizations/{organization}/muteConfigs/{configId},
  folders/{folder}/muteConfigs/{configId},
  or projects/{project}/muteConfigs/{configId}

* `create_time` -
  The time at which the mute config was created. This field is set by
  the server and will be ignored if provided on config creation.
