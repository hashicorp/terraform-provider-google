## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `replication` -
  (Required)
  The replication policy of the secret data attached to the Secret. It cannot be changed
  after the Secret has been created.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication).

* `secret_id` -
  (Required)
  This must be unique within the project.


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  The labels assigned to this Secret.
  Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes,
  and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}
  Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes,
  and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}
  No more than 64 labels can be assigned to a given resource.
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example:
  { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Custom metadata about the secret.
  Annotations are distinct from various forms of labels. Annotations exist to allow
  client tools to store their own state information without requiring a database.
  Annotation keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of
  maximum 128 bytes, begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]), and
  may have dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics in between these
  symbols.
  The total size of annotation keys and values must be less than 16KiB.
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example:
  { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_annotations` for all of the annotations present on the resource.

* `version_aliases` -
  (Optional)
  Mapping from version alias to version name.
  A version alias is a string with a maximum length of 63 characters and can contain
  uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and the hyphen (-) and underscore ('_')
  characters. An alias string must start with a letter and cannot be the string
  'latest' or 'NEW'. No more than 50 aliases can be assigned to a given secret.
  An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example:
  { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

* `version_destroy_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  Secret Version TTL after destruction request.
  This is a part of the delayed delete feature on Secret Version.
  For secret with versionDestroyTtl>0, version destruction doesn't happen immediately
  on calling destroy instead the version goes to a disabled state and
  the actual destruction happens after this TTL expires.

* `topics` -
  (Optional)
  A list of up to 10 Pub/Sub topics to which messages are published when control plane operations are called on the secret or its versions.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_topics).

* `expire_time` -
  (Optional)
  Timestamp in UTC when the Secret is scheduled to expire. This is always provided on output, regardless of what was sent on input.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".
  Only one of `expire_time` or `ttl` can be provided.

* `ttl` -
  (Optional)
  The TTL for the Secret.
  A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
  Only one of `ttl` or `expire_time` can be provided.

* `rotation` -
  (Optional)
  The rotation time and period for a Secret. At `next_rotation_time`, Secret Manager will send a Pub/Sub notification to the topics configured on the Secret. `topics` must be set to configure rotation.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rotation).

* `tags` -
  (Optional)
  A map of resource manager tags.
  Resource manager tag keys and values have the same definition as resource manager tags.
  Keys must be in the format tagKeys/{tag_key_id}, and values are in the format tagValues/{tag_value_id}.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_protection` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the secret. Defaults to false.
When the field is set to true in Terraform state, a `terraform apply`
or `terraform destroy` that would delete the secret will fail.



<a name="nested_replication"></a>The `replication` block supports:

* `auto` -
  (Optional)

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_auto).

* `user_managed` -

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_replication_user_managed).


<a name="nested_replication_auto"></a>The `auto` block supports:

* `customer_managed_encryption` -
  (Optional)
  The customer-managed encryption configuration of the Secret.
  If no configuration is provided, Google-managed default
  encryption is used.

## Import


Secret can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/secrets/{{secret_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{secret_id}}`

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Secret using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {

  to = google_secret_manager_secret.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Secret can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_secret_manager_secret.default projects/{{project}}/secrets/{{secret_id}}
