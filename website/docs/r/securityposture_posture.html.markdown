# google\_securityposture\_posture

A Posture represents a collection of policy set including its name, state, description
and policy sets. A policy set includes set of policies along with their definition.
A posture can be created at the organization level.
Every update to a deployed posture creates a new posture revision with an updated revision_id.


To get more information about Posture, see:

* How-to Guides
    * [Create and deploy a posture](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-use-security-posture)

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Posture using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/postures/{{posture_id}}"
  to = google_securityposture_posture.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Posture can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_securityposture_posture.default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/postures/{{posture_id}}
```
