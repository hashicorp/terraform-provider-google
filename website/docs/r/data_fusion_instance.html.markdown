## Example Usage - Data Fusion Instance Full


```hcl
resource "google_data_fusion_instance" "extended_instance" {
  provider = google-beta
  name = "my-instance"
  description = "My Data Fusion instance"
  region = "us-central1"
  type = "BASIC"
  enable_stackdriver_logging = true
  enable_stackdriver_monitoring = true
  labels = {
    example_key = "example_value"
  }
  private_instance = true
  network_config {
    network = "default"
    ip_allocation = "10.89.48.0/22"
  }
  version = "6.3.0"
  dataproc_service_account = data.google_app_engine_default_service_account.default.email
}

data "google_app_engine_default_service_account" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the instance or a fully qualified identifier for the instance.

* `type` -
  (Required)
  Represents the type of Data Fusion instance. Each type is configured with
  the default settings for processing and memory.
  - BASIC: Basic Data Fusion instance. In Basic type, the user will be able to create data pipelines
  using point and click UI. However, there are certain limitations, such as fewer number
  of concurrent pipelines, no support for streaming pipelines, etc.
  - ENTERPRISE: Enterprise Data Fusion instance. In Enterprise type, the user will have more features
  available, such as support for streaming pipelines, higher number of concurrent pipelines, etc.
  - DEVELOPER: Developer Data Fusion instance. In Developer type, the user will have all features available but
  with restrictive capabilities. This is to help enterprises design and develop their data ingestion and integration 
  pipelines at low cost.
  Possible values are `BASIC`, `ENTERPRISE`, and `DEVELOPER`.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of the instance.

* `enable_stackdriver_logging` -
  (Optional)
  Option to enable Stackdriver Logging.

* `enable_stackdriver_monitoring` -
  (Optional)
  Option to enable Stackdriver Monitoring.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  The resource labels for instance to use to annotate any related underlying resources,
  such as Compute Engine VMs.

* `options` -
  (Optional)
  Map of additional options used to configure the behavior of Data Fusion instance.

* `version` -
  (Optional)
  Current version of the Data Fusion.

* `private_instance` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies whether the Data Fusion instance should be private. If set to
  true, all Data Fusion nodes will have private IP addresses and will not be
  able to access the public internet.

* `dataproc_service_account` -
  (Optional)
  User-managed service account to set on Dataproc when Cloud Data Fusion creates Dataproc to run data processing pipelines.

* `network_config` -
  (Optional)
  Network configuration options. These are required when a private Data Fusion instance is to be created.
  Structure is documented below.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The region of the Data Fusion instance.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `network_config` block supports:

* `ip_allocation` -
  (Required)
  The IP range in CIDR notation to use for the managed Data Fusion instance
  nodes. This range must not overlap with any other ranges used in the Data Fusion instance network.

* `network` -
  (Required)
  Name of the network in the project with which the tenant project
  will be peered for executing pipelines. In case of shared VPC where the network resides in another host
  project the network should specified in the form of projects/{host-project-id}/global/networks/{network}

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/instances/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  The time the instance was created in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds.

* `update_time` -
  The time the instance was last updated in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds.

* `state` -

  - CREATING: Instance is being created
  - RUNNING: Instance is running and ready for requests
  - FAILED: Instance creation failed
  - DELETING: Instance is being deleted
  - UPGRADING: Instance is being upgraded
  - RESTARTING: Instance is being restarted

* `state_message` -
  Additional information about the current state of this Data Fusion instance if available.

* `service_endpoint` -
  Endpoint on which the Data Fusion UI and REST APIs are accessible.

* `service_account` -
  Service account which will be used to access resources in the customer project.
