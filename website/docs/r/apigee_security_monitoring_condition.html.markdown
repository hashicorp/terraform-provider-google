## Example Usage - Apigee Security Monitoring Condition Basic


```hcl
data "google_client_config" "current" {}

resource "google_compute_network" "apigee_network" {
  name = "apigee-network"
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "apigee_range" {
  name          = "apigee-range"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "apigee_vpc_connection" {
  network                 = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.apigee_range.name]
}

resource "google_apigee_organization" "apigee_org" {
  analytics_region   = "us-central1"
  project_id         = data.google_client_config.current.project
  authorized_network = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
  depends_on         = [google_service_networking_connection.apigee_vpc_connection]
}

resource "google_apigee_environment" "env" {
  name         = "my-environment"
  description  = "Apigee Environment"
  display_name = "environment-1"
  org_id       = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.id
}

resource "google_apigee_addons_config" "apigee_org_security_addons_config" {
  org = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.name
  addons_config {
    api_security_config {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}

resource "google_apigee_security_monitoring_condition" "security_monitoring_condition" {
  condition_id = "my-condition"
  org_id       = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.id
  profile      = "google-default"
  scope        = "my-environment"
  include_all_resources {}
  depends_on = [
    google_apigee_addons_config.apigee_org_security_addons_config
  ]
}
```

## Import


SecurityMonitoringCondition can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{org_id}}/securityMonitoringConditions/{{condition_id}}`
* `{{org_id}}/{{condition_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SecurityMonitoringCondition using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{org_id}}/securityMonitoringConditions/{{condition_id}}"
  to = google_apigee_security_monitoring_condition.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SecurityMonitoringCondition can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apigee_security_monitoring_condition.default {{org_id}}/securityMonitoringConditions/{{condition_id}}
$ terraform import google_apigee_security_monitoring_condition.default {{org_id}}/{{condition_id}}
```
