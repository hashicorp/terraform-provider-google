# google\_storage\_notification

Creates a new notification configuration on a specified bucket, establishing a flow of event notifications from GCS to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
 For more information see 
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications) 
and 
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/notifications).

In order to enable notifications, a special Google Cloud Storage service account unique to the project
must have the IAM permission "projects.topics.publish" for a Cloud Pub/Sub topic in the project. To get the service
account's email address, use the `google_storage_project_service_account` datasource's `email_address` value, and see below
for an example of enabling notifications by granting the correct IAM permission. See
[the notifications documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/notification) for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_storage_notification" "notification" {
  bucket         = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  payload_format = "JSON_API_V1"
  topic          = google_pubsub_topic.topic.name
  event_types    = ["OBJECT_FINALIZE", "OBJECT_METADATA_UPDATE"]
  custom_attributes = {
    new-attribute = "new-attribute-value"
  }
  depends_on = [google_pubsub_topic_iam_binding.binding]
}

// Enable notifications by giving the correct IAM permission to the unique service account.

data "google_storage_project_service_account" "gcs_account" {
}

resource "google_pubsub_topic_iam_binding" "binding" {
  topic   = google_pubsub_topic.topic.name
  role    = "roles/pubsub.publisher"
  members = ["serviceAccount:${data.google_storage_project_service_account.gcs_account.email_address}"]
}

// End enabling notifications

resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name = "default_bucket"
}

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "topic" {
  name = "default_topic"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket.

* `payload_format` - (Required) The desired content of the Payload. One of `"JSON_API_V1"` or `"NONE"`.

* `topic` - (Required) The Cloud PubSub topic to which this subscription publishes. Expects either the 
    topic name, assumed to belong to the default GCP provider project, or the project-level name, 
    i.e. `projects/my-gcp-project/topics/my-topic` or `my-topic`.
    
- - -

* `custom_attributes` - (Optional)  A set of key/value attribute pairs to attach to each Cloud PubSub message published for this notification subscription

* `event_types` - (Optional) List of event type filters for this notification config. If not specified, Cloud Storage will send notifications for all event types. The valid types are: `"OBJECT_FINALIZE"`, `"OBJECT_METADATA_UPDATE"`, `"OBJECT_DELETE"`, `"OBJECT_ARCHIVE"`

* `object_name_prefix` - (Optional) Specifies a prefix path filter for this notification config. Cloud Storage will only send notifications for objects in this bucket whose names begin with the specified prefix.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `notification_id` - The ID of the created notification.

* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.

## Import

Storage notifications can be imported using the notification `id` in the format `<bucket_name>/notificationConfigs/<id>` e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_storage_notification.notification default_bucket/notificationConfigs/102
```
