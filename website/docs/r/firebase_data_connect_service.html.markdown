## Example Usage - Firebasedataconnect Service Basic


```hcl
# Enable Firebase Data Connect API
resource "google_project_service" "fdc" {
  project = "my-project-name"
  service = "firebasedataconnect.googleapis.com"
}

# Create a Firebase Data Connect service
resource "google_firebase_data_connect_service" "default" {
  project = "my-project-name"
  location = "us-central1"
  service_id = "example-service"
  deletion_policy = "DEFAULT"

  labels = {
    label = "my-label"
  }

  annotations = {
    key1 = "value1",
    key2 = "value2",
  }

  depends_on = [google_project_service.fdc]
}
```
## Example Usage - Firebasedataconnect Service With Force Deletion


```hcl
# Enable Firebase Data Connect API
resource "google_project_service" "fdc" {
  project = "my-project-name"
  service = "firebasedataconnect.googleapis.com"
}

# Create a Firebase Data Connect service
resource "google_firebase_data_connect_service" "default" {
  project = "my-project-name"
  location = "us-central1"
  service_id = "example-service"
  deletion_policy = "FORCE"

  depends_on = [google_project_service.fdc]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

  (Required)
  The region in which the service resides, e.g. "us-central1" or "asia-east1".

* `service_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. The ID to use for the service, which will become the final component of the
  service's resource name.


* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Mutable human-readable name. 63 character limit.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Stores small amounts of arbitrary data.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Labels as key value pairs.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Import


Service can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{service_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{service_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{service_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Service using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    location = "<-required value->"
    serviceId = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_firebase_data_connect_service.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Service using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{service_id}}"
  to = google_firebase_data_connect_service.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Service can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_data_connect_service.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{service_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_data_connect_service.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{service_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_data_connect_service.default {{location}}/{{service_id}}
```
