# google_monitoring_monitored_project

Beta only: Monitored Project allows you to set a project as monitored by a _metrics scope_, which is a term for a project used to group the metrics of multiple projects, potentially across multiple organizations.  This enables you to view these groups in the Monitoring page of the cloud console.

For more information, see:
* [Understanding metrics scopes](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/settings#concept-scope)
* [API notes](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/settings/manage-api)
## Example Usage - basic_monitored_project
A basic example of a monitoring monitored project
```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_monitored_project" "primary" {
  metrics_scope = "existing-metrics-scope-project"
  name          = google_project.basic.name
  provider      = google-beta
}
resource "google_project" "basic" {
  project_id = "my-monitored-project"
  name       = "my-monitored-project"
  org_id     = "123456789"
  provider   = google-beta
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `metrics_scope` -
  (Required)
  Required. The resource name of the existing Metrics Scope that will monitor this project. Example: locations/global/metricsScopes/{SCOPING_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER}
  
* `name` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The resource name of the `MonitoredProject`. On input, the resource name includes the scoping project ID and monitored project ID. On output, it contains the equivalent project numbers. Example: `locations/global/metricsScopes/{SCOPING_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER}/projects/{MONITORED_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER}`
