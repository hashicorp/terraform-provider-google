# google_firebase_project

A Google Cloud Firebase instance. This enables Firebase resources on a given Google Project.
Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP Project, a FirebaseProject uses underlying GCP
identifiers (most importantly, the projectId) as its own for easy interop with GCP APIs.
Once Firebase has been added to a Google Project it cannot be removed.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](../guides/provider_versions.html.markdown) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Project, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/projects)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/terraform/get-started)

~> **Note:** This resource should usually be used with a provider configuration
with `user_project_override = true` unless you wish for your quota
project to be different from the Firebase project.

## Example Usage - Firebase Project Basic


```hcl
resource "google_project" "default" {
  provider = google-beta

  project_id = "my-project"
  name       = "my-project"
  org_id     = "123456789"
  deletion_policy = "DELETE"

  labels = {
    "firebase" = "enabled"
  }
}

resource "google_firebase_project" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = google_project.default.project_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:



* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}`

* `project_number` -
  The number of the Google Project that Firebase is enabled on.

* `display_name` -
  The GCP project display name


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Project can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}`
* `{{project}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Project using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}"
  to = google_firebase_project.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Project can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_project.default projects/{{project}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_project.default {{project}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
