# google\_firebase\_project

A Google Cloud Firebase instance. This enables Firebase resources on a given google project.
Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP Project, a FirebaseProject uses underlying GCP
identifiers (most importantly, the projectId) as its own for easy interop with GCP APIs.
Once Firebase has been added to a Google Project it cannot be removed.
