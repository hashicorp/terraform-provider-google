## Example Usage - Network Services Agent Gateway Full


```hcl
resource "google_network_services_agent_gateway" "default" {
  name     = "my-full-agent-gateway"
  location = "us-central1"
  description = "A full configuration for Agent Gateway"
  labels = {
    env = "test"
    tier = "gold"
  }

  protocols = ["MCP"]
  google_managed {
    governed_access_path = "AGENT_TO_ANYWHERE"
  }

  registries = [
    "//agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/my-project-name/locations/us-central1"
  ]

  network_config {
    egress {
      network_attachment = "projects/my-project-name/regions/us-central1/networkAttachments/my-network-attachment"
    }
  }
