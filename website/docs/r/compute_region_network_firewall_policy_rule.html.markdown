## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `priority` -
  (Required)
  An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list.
  The priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647.
  Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest prority.

* `match` -
  (Required)
  A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_match).

* `action` -
  (Required)
  The Action to perform when the client connection triggers the rule. Valid actions are "allow", "deny", "goto_next" and "apply_security_profile_group".

* `direction` -
  (Required)
  The direction in which this rule applies.
  Possible values are: `INGRESS`, `EGRESS`.

* `firewall_policy` -
  (Required)
  The firewall policy of the resource.


* `rule_name` -
  (Optional)
  An optional name for the rule. This field is not a unique identifier and can be updated.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description for this resource.

* `security_profile_group` -
  (Optional)
  A fully-qualified URL of a SecurityProfile resource instance.
  Example: https://networksecurity.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/securityProfileGroups/my-security-profile-group
  Must be specified if action = 'apply_security_profile_group' and cannot be specified for other actions.
  Security Profile Group and Firewall Policy Rule must be in the same scope.

* `tls_inspect` -
  (Optional)
  Boolean flag indicating if the traffic should be TLS decrypted.
  Can be set only if action = 'apply_security_profile_group' and cannot be set for other actions.

* `enable_logging` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether to enable logging for a particular rule.
  If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to the configured export destination in Stackdriver.
  Logs may be exported to BigQuery or Pub/Sub.
  Note: you cannot enable logging on "goto_next" rules.

* `target_service_accounts` -
  (Optional)
  A list of service accounts indicating the sets of instances that are applied with this rule.

* `target_secure_tags` -
  (Optional)
  A list of secure tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to.
  If targetSecureTag are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those EFFECTIVE secure tags, if all the targetSecureTag are in INEFFECTIVE state, then this rule will be ignored.
  targetSecureTag may not be set at the same time as targetServiceAccounts. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetSecureTag are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network. Maximum number of target label tags allowed is 256.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target_secure_tags).

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether the firewall policy rule is disabled.
  When set to true, the firewall policy rule is not enforced and traffic behaves as if it did not exist.
  If this is unspecified, the firewall policy rule will be enabled.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The location of this resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_match_src_secure_tags).

* `dest_address_groups` -
  (Optional)
  Address groups which should be matched against the traffic destination. Maximum number of destination address groups is 10.
