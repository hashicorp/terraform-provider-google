# google_chronicle_rule_deployment

The RuleDeployment resource represents the deployment state of a Rule.


To get more information about RuleDeployment, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/rest/v1/RuleDeployment)
* How-to Guides
    * [Google SecOps Guides](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/secops/secops-overview)

## Example Usage - Chronicle Ruledeployment Basic


```hcl
resource "google_chronicle_rule" "my-rule" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 text = <<-EOT
             rule test_rule { meta: events:  $userid = $e.principal.user.userid  match: $userid over 10m condition: $e }
         EOT
}

resource "google_chronicle_rule_deployment" "example" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 rule = element(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name), length(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name)) - 1)
 enabled = true
 alerting = true
 archived = false
 run_frequency = "DAILY"
}
```
## Example Usage - Chronicle Ruledeployment Disabled


```hcl
resource "google_chronicle_rule" "my-rule" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 text = <<-EOT
             rule test_rule { meta: events:  $userid = $e.principal.user.userid  match: $userid over 10m condition: $e }
         EOT
}

resource "google_chronicle_rule_deployment" "example" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 rule = element(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name), length(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name)) - 1)
 enabled = false
 run_frequency = "LIVE"
}
```
## Example Usage - Chronicle Ruledeployment Run Frequency Missing


```hcl
resource "google_chronicle_rule" "my-rule" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 text = <<-EOT
             rule test_rule { meta: events:  $userid = $e.principal.user.userid  match: $userid over 10m condition: $e }
         EOT
}

resource "google_chronicle_rule_deployment" "example" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 rule = element(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name), length(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name)) - 1)
 enabled = true
 alerting = true
 archived = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the resource. This is the geographical region where the Chronicle instance resides, such as "us" or "europe-west2".

* `instance` -
  (Required)
  The unique identifier for the Chronicle instance, which is the same as the customer ID.

* `rule` -
  (Required)
  The Rule ID of the rule.


* `enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether the rule is currently deployed continuously against incoming data.

* `alerting` -
  (Optional)
  Whether detections resulting from this deployment should be considered
  alerts.

* `archived` -
  (Optional)
  The archive state of the rule deployment.
  Cannot be set to true unless enabled is set to false i.e.
  archiving requires a two-step process: first, disable the rule by
  setting 'enabled' to false, then set 'archive' to true.
  If set to true, alerting will automatically be set to false.
  If currently set to true, enabled, alerting, and run_frequency cannot be
  updated.

* `run_frequency` -
  (Optional)
  The run frequency of the rule deployment.
  Possible values:
  LIVE
  HOURLY
  DAILY

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment`

* `name` -
  The resource name of the rule deployment.
  Note that RuleDeployment is a child of the overall Rule, not any individual
  revision, so the resource ID segment for the Rule resource must not
  reference a specific revision.
  Format:
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}/deployment

* `archive_time` -
  Output only. The timestamp when the rule deployment archive state was last set to true. If the rule deployment's current archive state is not set to true, the field will be empty.

* `execution_state` -
  The execution state of the rule deployment.
  Possible values:
  DEFAULT
  LIMITED
  PAUSED

* `producer_rules` -
  Output only. The names of the associated/chained producer rules. Rules are considered
  producers for this rule if this rule explicitly filters on their ruleid.
  Format:
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}

* `consumer_rules` -
  Output only. The names of the associated/chained consumer rules. Rules are considered
  consumers of this rule if their rule text explicitly filters on this rule's ruleid.
  Format:
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}

* `last_alert_status_change_time` -
  Output only. The timestamp when the rule deployment alert state was lastly changed. This is filled regardless of the current alert state.E.g. if the current alert status is false, this timestamp will be the timestamp when the alert status was changed to false.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


RuleDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}`
* `{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RuleDeployment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment"
  to = google_chronicle_rule_deployment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), RuleDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_chronicle_rule_deployment.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/deployment
$ terraform import google_chronicle_rule_deployment.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}
$ terraform import google_chronicle_rule_deployment.default {{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
