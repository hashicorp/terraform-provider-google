# google\_compute\_https\_health\_check

Manages an HTTPS health check within GCE. This is used to monitor instances
behind load balancers. Timeouts or HTTPS errors cause the instance to be
removed from the pool. For more information, see [the official
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/httpsHealthChecks).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_https_health_check" "default" {
  name         = "test"
  request_path = "/health_check"

  timeout_sec        = 1
  check_interval_sec = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE. Changing
    this forces a new resource to be created.

- - -

* `check_interval_sec` - (Optional) How often to poll each instance (default 5).

* `description` - (Optional) Textual description field.

* `healthy_threshold` - (Optional) Consecutive successes required (default 2).

* `host` - (Optional) HTTPS host header field (default instance's public ip).

* `port` - (Optional) TCP port to connect to (default 443).

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it
