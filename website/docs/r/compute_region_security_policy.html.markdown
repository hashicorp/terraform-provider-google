## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `type` -
  (Optional)
  The type indicates the intended use of the security policy.
  - CLOUD_ARMOR: Cloud Armor backend security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services. They filter requests before they hit the origin servers.
  - CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE: Cloud Armor edge security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services (including Cloud CDN-enabled) as well as backend buckets (Cloud Storage). They filter requests before the request is served from Google's cache.
  - CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK: Cloud Armor network policies can be configured to filter packets targeting network load balancing resources such as backend services, target pools, target instances, and instances with external IPs. They filter requests before the request is served from the application.
  This field can be set only at resource creation time.
  Possible values are: `CLOUD_ARMOR`, `CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE`, `CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK`.

* `ddos_protection_config` -

  Definitions of user-defined fields for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK policies.
  A user-defined field consists of up to 4 bytes extracted from a fixed offset in the packet, relative to the IPv4, IPv6, TCP, or UDP header, with an optional mask to select certain bits.
  Rules may then specify matching values for these fields.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_user_defined_fields).

* `rules` -
  (Optional)
  The set of rules that belong to this policy. There must always be a default rule (rule with priority 2147483647 and match "*"). If no rules are provided when creating a security policy, a default rule with action "allow" will be added.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rules).

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The Region in which the created Region Security Policy should reside.
  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_ddos_protection_config"></a>The `ddos_protection_config` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Optional)
  The name of this field. Must be unique within the policy.

* `base` -
  (Required)
  The base relative to which 'offset' is measured. Possible values are:
  - IPV4: Points to the beginning of the IPv4 header.
  - IPV6: Points to the beginning of the IPv6 header.
  - TCP: Points to the beginning of the TCP header, skipping over any IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers. Not present for non-first fragments.
  - UDP: Points to the beginning of the UDP header, skipping over any IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers. Not present for non-first fragments.
  Possible values are: `IPV4`, `IPV6`, `TCP`, `UDP`.

* `offset` -
  (Optional)
  Offset of the first byte of the field (in network byte order) relative to 'base'.

* `size` -
  (Optional)
  Size of the field in bytes. Valid values: 1-4.

* `mask` -
  (Optional)
  If specified, apply this mask (bitwise AND) to the field to ignore bits before matching.
  Encoded as a hexadecimal number (starting with "0x").
  The last byte of the field (in network byte order) corresponds to the least significant byte of the mask.

<a name="nested_rules"></a>The `rules` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `priority` -
  (Required)
  An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list.
  The priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647.
  Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.

* `match` -
  (Optional)
  A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against.
  If it evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_match).

* `preconfigured_waf_config` -
  (Optional)
  Preconfigured WAF configuration to be applied for the rule.
  If the rule does not evaluate preconfigured WAF rules, i.e., if evaluatePreconfiguredWaf() is not used, this field will have no effect.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_preconfigured_waf_config).

* `action` -
  (Required)
  The Action to perform when the rule is matched. The following are the valid actions:
  * allow: allow access to target.
  * deny(STATUS): deny access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified. Valid values for STATUS are 403, 404, and 502.
  * rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set.
  * redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR.
  * throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set for this.

* `rate_limit_options` -
  (Optional)
  Must be specified if the action is "rate_based_ban" or "throttle". Cannot be specified for any other actions.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rate_limit_options).

* `preview` -
  (Optional)
  If set to true, the specified action is not enforced.

* `network_match` -
  (Optional)
  A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
  The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and potentially multiple user-defined match fields ('userDefinedFields').
  Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds.
  Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all.
  For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.
  Example:
  networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff"
  The above match condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_match).

  Possible values are: `SRC_IPS_V1`.

* `expr` -
  (Optional)
  User defined CEVAL expression. A CEVAL expression is used to specify match criteria such as origin.ip, source.region_code and contents in the request header. See [Sample expressions](https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs/configure-security-policies#sample-expressions) for examples.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_expr).

## Import


RegionSecurityPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/securityPolicies/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}`
* `{{region}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RegionSecurityPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/securityPolicies/{{name}}"
  to = google_compute_region_security_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), RegionSecurityPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_region_security_policy.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/securityPolicies/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_region_security_policy.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_region_security_policy.default {{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_region_security_policy.default {{name}}
```
