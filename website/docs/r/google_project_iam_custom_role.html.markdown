# google\_project\_iam\_custom\_role

Allows management of a customized Cloud IAM project role. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles).

~> **Warning:** Note that custom roles in GCP have the concept of a soft-delete. There are two issues that may arise
 from this and how roles are propagated. 1) creating a role may involve undeleting and then updating a role with the
 same name, possibly causing confusing behavior between undelete and update. 2) A deleted role is permanently deleted
 after 7 days, but it can take up to 30 more days (i.e. between 7 and 37 days after deletion) before the role name is
 made available again. This means a deleted role that has been deleted for more than 7 days cannot be changed at all
 by Terraform, and new roles cannot share that name.

## Example Usage

This snippet creates a customized IAM role.

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "my-custom-role" {
  role_id     = "myCustomRole"
  title       = "My Custom Role"
  description = "A description"
  permissions = ["iam.roles.list", "iam.roles.create", "iam.roles.delete"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `role_id` - (Required) The role id to use for this role.

* `title` - (Required) A human-readable title for the role.

* `project` - (Optional) The project that the service account will be created in.
    Defaults to the provider project configuration.

* `stage` - (Optional) The current launch stage of the role.
