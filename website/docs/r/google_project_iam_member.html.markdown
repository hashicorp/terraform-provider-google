# google\_project\_iam\_member

Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
the IAM policy for an existing Google Cloud Platform project.

~> **Note:** This resource _must not_ be used in conjunction with
   `google_project_iam_policy` or they will fight over what your policy
   should be. Similarly, roles controlled by `google_project_iam_binding`
   should not be assigned to using `google_project_iam_member`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_member" "project" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  role    = "roles/editor"
  member  = "user:jane@example.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `member` - (Required) The identity that will be granted the privilege in the `role`.
  This field can have one of the following values:
  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
  * **domain:{domain}**: A Google Apps domain name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

* `project` - (Optional) The project ID. If not specified, uses the
    ID of the project configured with the provider.
    
## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the project's IAM policy.

## Import

IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.  This member resource can be imported using the `project_id`, role, and account e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_project_iam_member.my_project "your-project-id roles/viewer foo@example.com"
```
