Allows creation and management of a single member for a single binding within
the IAM policy for an existing Google Cloud Platform project.

## Example Usage

resource "google_project_iam_member" "project" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  role    = "roles/editor"
  member  = "user:jane@example.com"
}
```
