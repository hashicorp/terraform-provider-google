# google\_access\_context\_manager\_egress\_policy

EgressPolicies match requests based on egressFrom and egressTo stanzas.
For an EgressPolicy to match, both egressFrom and egressTo stanzas must be matched.
If an EgressPolicy matches a request, the request is allowed to span the ServicePerimeter
boundary. For example, an EgressPolicy can be used to allow VMs on networks
within the ServicePerimeter to access a defined set of projects outside the
perimeter in certain contexts (e.g. to read data from a Cloud Storage bucket
or query against a BigQuery dataset).


To get more information about EgressPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.servicePerimeters#egresspolicy)
