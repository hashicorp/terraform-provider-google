# google\_firebase\_hosting\_custom\_domain

Manages Custom Domains for Firebase Hosting. Custom Domains link your
domain names with Firebase Hosting sites, allowing Hosting to serve content
on those domain names.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about CustomDomain, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/projects.sites.customDomains)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Customdomain Basic


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_hosting_custom_domain" "default" {
  provider = google-beta

  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id = "site-id"
  custom_domain = "custom.domain.com"
}
```
## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Customdomain Full


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_hosting_site" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = "my-project-name"

  site_id = "site-id-full"
}

resource "google_firebase_hosting_custom_domain" "default" {
  provider = google-beta

  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  custom_domain = "source.domain.com"
  cert_preference = "GROUPED"
  redirect_target = "destination.domain.com"

  wait_dns_verification = false
}
```
## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Customdomain Cloud Run


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_hosting_site" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id  = "site-id"
}

resource "google_cloud_run_v2_service" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = "my-project-name"
  name     = "cloud-run-service-via-hosting"
  location = "us-central1"

  # Warning: allows all public traffic
  ingress = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL"

  template {
    containers {
      image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
    }
  }
}

resource "google_firebase_hosting_version" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  site_id  = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  config {
    rewrites {
      glob = "/hello/**"
      run {
        service_id = google_cloud_run_v2_service.default.name
        region = google_cloud_run_v2_service.default.location
      }
    }
  }
}

  provider     = google-beta
  site_id      = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  version_name = google_firebase_hosting_version.default.name
  message      = "Cloud Run Integration"
}

resource "google_firebase_hosting_custom_domain" "default" {
  provider = google-beta

  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id  = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  custom_domain = "run.custom.domain.com"

  wait_dns_verification = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `site_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the site in which to create this custom domain association.

* `custom_domain` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the `CustomDomain`, which is the domain name you'd like to use with Firebase Hosting.


- - -


* `cert_preference` -
  (Optional)
  A field that lets you specify which SSL certificate type Hosting creates
  for your domain name. Spark plan `CustomDomain`s only have access to the
  `GROUPED` cert type, while Blaze plan can select any option.
  Possible values are: `GROUPED`, `PROJECT_GROUPED`, `DEDICATED`.

* `redirect_target` -
  (Optional)
  A domain name that this CustomDomain should direct traffic towards. If
  specified, Hosting will respond to requests against this CustomDomain
  with an HTTP 301 code, and route traffic to the specified `redirect_target`
  instead.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `wait_dns_verification` - (Optional) If true, Terraform will wait for DNS records to be fully resolved on the `CustomDomain`.
If false, Terraform will not wait for DNS records on the `CustomDomain`. Any issues in
the `CustomDomain` will be returned and stored in the Terraform state.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/sites/{{site_id}}/customDomains/{{custom_domain}}`

* `name` -
  The fully-qualified name of the `CustomDomain`.

* `create_time` -
  The `CustomDomain`'s create time.

* `update_time` -
  The last time the `CustomDomain` was updated.

* `delete_time` -
  The time the `CustomDomain` was deleted; null for `CustomDomains` that
  haven't been deleted. Deleted `CustomDomains` persist for approximately 30
  days, after which time Hosting removes them completely.

* `expire_time` -
  The minimum time before a soft-deleted `CustomDomain` is completely removed
  from Hosting; null for `CustomDomains` that haven't been deleted.

* `etag` -
  A string that represents the current state of the `CustomDomain` and
  allows you to confirm its initial state in requests that would modify it.

* `host_state` -
  The host state of your domain name. Host state is determined by checking each
  IP address associated with your domain name to see if it's serving
  Hosting content.
    HOST_UNHOSTED:
      Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name isn't associated with any IP addresses.
    HOST_UNREACHABLE:
      Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
      queries to find your domain name's IP addresses resulted in errors. See
      your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.
    HOST_MISMATCH:
      Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that don't ultimately
      resolve to Hosting.
    HOST_CONFLICT:
      Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that resolve to both
      Hosting and other services. To ensure consistent results, remove `A` and
      `AAAA` records related to non-Hosting services.
    HOST_ACTIVE:
      All requests against your `CustomDomain`'s domain name are served by
      Hosting. If the `CustomDomain`'s `OwnershipState` is also `ACTIVE`, Hosting
      serves your Hosting Site's content on the domain name.

* `ownership_state` -
  The ownership state of your domain name. Ownership is determined at a
  Firebase project level, and established by adding `TXT` records to your
  domain name's DNS records.
  Ownership cascades to subdomains. Granting a project ownership of `foo.com`
  also grants that project ownership over `bar.foo.com`, unless you add
  specific `TXT` records to `bar.foo.com` that grant a different project
  ownership.
  If your `CustomDomain` is in an `OwnershipState` other than
  `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE` for more than 30 days and it hasn't been updated in at
  least 30 days, Hosting's ownership systems delete the `CustomDomain`.
  OWNERSHIP_MISSING:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has no Hosting-related ownership records;
    no Firebase project has permission to act on the domain name's behalf.
  OWNERSHIP_UNREACHABLE:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
    queries to find your domain name's ownership records resulted in errors.
    See your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.
  OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name is owned by another Firebase project.
    Remove the conflicting `TXT` records and replace them with project-specific
    records for your current Firebase project.
  OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has conflicting `TXT` records that
    indicate ownership by both your current Firebase project and another
    project. Remove the other project's ownership records to grant the current
    project ownership.
  OWNERSHIP_PENDING:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s DNS records are configured correctly. Hosting will
    transfer ownership of your domain to this `CustomDomain` within 24 hours.
  OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE:
    Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has `TXT` records that grant its project
    permission to act on its behalf.

* `required_dns_updates` -
  A set of updates you should make to the domain name's DNS records to
  let Hosting serve secure content on its behalf.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_required_dns_updates).

* `issues` -
  A set of errors Hosting systems encountered when trying to establish
  Hosting's ability to serve secure content for your domain name. Resolve
  these issues to ensure your `CustomDomain` behaves properly.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_issues).

* `cert` -
  The SSL certificate Hosting has for this `CustomDomain`'s domain name.
  For new `CustomDomain`s, this often represents Hosting's intent to create
  a certificate, rather than an actual cert. Check the `state` field for
  more.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_cert).

* `reconciling` -
  if true, indicates that Hosting's systems are attmepting to
  make the `CustomDomain`'s state match your preferred state. This is most
  frequently `true` when initially provisioning a `CustomDomain` or when creating
  a new SSL certificate to match an updated `cert_preference`
