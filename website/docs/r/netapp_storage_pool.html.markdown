  Storage pools act as containers for volumes.

# google_netapp_storage_pool

Storage pools act as containers for volumes. All volumes in a storage pool share the following information:
* Location
* Service level
* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
* Active Directory policy
* LDAP use for NFS volumes, if applicable
* Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) policy

The capacity of the pool can be split up and assigned to volumes within the pool. Storage pools are a billable
component of NetApp Volumes. Billing is based on the location, service level, and capacity allocated to a pool
independent of consumption at the volume level.


To get more information about storagePool, see:

## Example Usage - Storage Pool Create


```hcl
# Create a network or use datasource to reference existing network
resource "google_compute_network" "peering_network" {
  name = "test-network"
}

# Reserve a CIDR for NetApp Volumes to use
# When using shared-VPCs, this resource needs to be created in host project
resource "google_compute_global_address" "private_ip_alloc" {
  name          = "test-address"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
}

# Create a Private Service Access connection
# When using shared-VPCs, this resource needs to be created in host project
resource "google_service_networking_connection" "default" {
  network                 = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
  service                 = "netapp.servicenetworking.goog"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.private_ip_alloc.name]
}

# Modify the PSA Connection to allow import/export of custom routes
# When using shared-VPCs, this resource needs to be created in host project
resource "google_compute_network_peering_routes_config" "route_updates" {
  peering = google_service_networking_connection.default.peering
  network = google_compute_network.peering_network.name

  import_custom_routes = true
  export_custom_routes = true
}

# Create a storage pool
# Create this resource in the project which is expected to own the volumes
resource "google_netapp_storage_pool" "test_pool" {
  name = "test-pool"
  # project = <your_project>
  location = "us-central1"
  service_level = "PREMIUM"
  capacity_gib = "2048"
  network = google_compute_network.peering_network.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `service_level` -
  (Required)
  Service level of the storage pool.
  Possible values are: `PREMIUM`, `EXTREME`, `STANDARD`, `FLEX`.

* `capacity_gib` -
  (Required)
  Capacity of the storage pool (in GiB).

* `network` -
  (Required)
  VPC network name with format: `projects/{{project}}/global/networks/{{network}}`

* `location` -
  (Required)
  Name of the location. Usually a region name, expect for some STANDARD service level pools which require a zone name.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the storage pool. Needs to be unique per location.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels as key value pairs. Example: `{ "owner": "Bob", "department": "finance", "purpose": "testing" }`.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `active_directory` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the Active Directory policy to be used. Format: `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/activeDirectories/{{name}}`.
  The policy needs to be in the same location as the storage pool.

* `kms_config` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the CMEK policy to be used for volume encryption. Format: `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/kmsConfigs/{{name}}`.
  The policy needs to be in the same location as the storage pool.

* `ldap_enabled` -
  (Optional)
  When enabled, the volumes uses Active Directory as LDAP name service for UID/GID lookups. Required to enable extended group support for NFSv3,
  using security identifiers for NFSv4.1 or principal names for kerberized NFSv4.1.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/storagePools/{{name}}`

* `volume_capacity_gib` -
  Size allocated to volumes in the storage pool (in GiB).

* `volume_count` -
  Number of volume in the storage pool.

* `encryption_type` -
  Reports if volumes in the pool are encrypted using a Google-managed encryption key or CMEK.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.

- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


storagePool can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/storagePools/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import storagePool using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/storagePools/{{name}}"
  to = google_netapp_storage_pool.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), storagePool can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_netapp_storage_pool.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/storagePools/{{name}}

$ terraform import google_netapp_storage_pool.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
