# google_compute_interconnect

Represents an Interconnect resource. The Interconnect resource is a dedicated connection between
Google's network and your on-premises network.


To get more information about Interconnect, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnects)
* How-to Guides
    * [Create a Dedicated Interconnect](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview)

## Example Usage - Compute Interconnect Basic


```hcl
data "google_project" "project" {}

resource "google_compute_interconnect" "example-interconnect" {
  name                 = "example-interconnect"
  customer_name        = "example_customer"
  interconnect_type    = "DEDICATED"
  link_type            = "LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR"
  location             = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/${data.google_project.project.name}/global/interconnectLocations/iad-zone1-1"
  requested_link_count = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be
  1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
  long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
  character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
  lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  URL of the InterconnectLocation object that represents where this connection is to be provisioned.

* `link_type` -
  (Required)
  Type of link requested. Note that this field indicates the speed of each of the links in the
  bundle, not the speed of the entire bundle. Can take one of the following values:
    - LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR: A 10G Ethernet with LR optics.
    - LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_100G_LR: A 100G Ethernet with LR optics.
  Possible values are: `LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_10G_LR`, `LINK_TYPE_ETHERNET_100G_LR`.

* `requested_link_count` -
  (Required)
  Target number of physical links in the link bundle, as requested by the customer.

* `interconnect_type` -
  (Required)
  Type of interconnect. Note that a value IT_PRIVATE has been deprecated in favor of DEDICATED.
  Can take one of the following values:
    - PARTNER: A partner-managed interconnection shared between customers though a partner.
    - DEDICATED: A dedicated physical interconnection with the customer.
  Possible values are: `DEDICATED`, `PARTNER`, `IT_PRIVATE`.

* `customer_name` -
  (Required)
  Customer name, to put in the Letter of Authorization as the party authorized to request a
  crossconnect.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `admin_enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Administrative status of the interconnect. When this is set to true, the Interconnect is
  functional and can carry traffic. When set to false, no packets can be carried over the
  interconnect and no BGP routes are exchanged over it. By default, the status is set to true.

* `noc_contact_email` -
  (Optional)
  Email address to contact the customer NOC for operations and maintenance notifications
  regarding this Interconnect. If specified, this will be used for notifications in addition to
  all other forms described, such as Cloud Monitoring logs alerting and Cloud Notifications.
  This field is required for users who sign up for Cloud Interconnect using workforce identity
  federation.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the setLabels
  method. Each label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `macsec` -
  (Optional)
  Configuration that enables Media Access Control security (MACsec) on the Cloud
  Interconnect connection between Google and your on-premises router.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_macsec).

* `macsec_enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Enable or disable MACsec on this Interconnect connection.
  MACsec enablement fails if the MACsec object is not specified.

* `remote_location` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates that this is a Cross-Cloud Interconnect. This field specifies the location outside
  of Google's network that the interconnect is connected to.

* `requested_features` -
  (Optional)
  interconnects.list of features requested for this Interconnect connection. Options: MACSEC (
  If specified then the connection is created on MACsec capable hardware ports. If not
  specified, the default value is false, which allocates non-MACsec capable ports first if
  available).
  Each value may be one of: `MACSEC`.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_macsec"></a>The `macsec` block supports:

* `pre_shared_keys` -
  (Required)
  A keychain placeholder describing a set of named key objects along with their
  start times. A MACsec CKN/CAK is generated for each key in the key chain.
  Google router automatically picks the key with the most recent startTime when establishing
  or re-establishing a MACsec secure link.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_pre_shared_keys).


<a name="nested_pre_shared_keys"></a>The `pre_shared_keys` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  A name for this pre-shared key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
   comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
   the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
   must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
   letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `start_time` -
  (Optional)
  A RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the key is valid. startTime can be in the
  future. If the keychain has a single key, startTime can be omitted. If the keychain
  has multiple keys, startTime is mandatory for each key. The start times of keys must
  be in increasing order. The start times of two consecutive keys must be at least 6
  hours apart.

* `fail_open` -
  (Optional)
  If set to true, the Interconnect connection is configured with a should-secure
  MACsec security policy, that allows the Google router to fallback to cleartext
  traffic if the MKA session cannot be established. By default, the Interconnect
  connection is configured with a must-secure security policy that drops all traffic
  if the MKA session cannot be established with your router.
