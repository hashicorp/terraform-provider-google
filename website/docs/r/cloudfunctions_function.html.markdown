# google\_cloudfunctions\_function

Creates a new Cloud Function. For more information see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.functions)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs)


~> **Warning:** As of November 1, 2019, newly created Functions are
private-by-default and will require [appropriate IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/reference/iam/roles)
to be invoked. See below examples for how to set up the appropriate permissions,
or view the [Cloud Functions IAM resources](/docs/providers/google/r/cloudfunctions_cloud_function_iam.html)
for Cloud Functions.

## Example Usage - Public Function

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name     = "test-bucket"
  location = "US"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "archive" {
  name   = "index.zip"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source = "./path/to/zip/file/which/contains/code"
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function" "function" {
  name        = "function-test"
  description = "My function"
  runtime     = "nodejs16"

  available_memory_mb   = 128
  source_archive_bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source_archive_object = google_storage_bucket_object.archive.name
  trigger_http          = true
  entry_point           = "helloGET"
}

# IAM entry for all users to invoke the function
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "invoker" {
  project        = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.project
  region         = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.region
  cloud_function = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.name

  role   = "roles/cloudfunctions.invoker"
  member = "allUsers"
}
```

* `trigger_http` - (Optional) Boolean variable. Any HTTP request (of a supported type) to the endpoint will trigger function execution. Supported HTTP request types are: POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, and OPTIONS. Endpoint is returned as `https_trigger_url`. Cannot be used with `event_trigger`.

* `https_trigger_security_level` - (Optional) The security level for the function. The following options are available:

    * `SECURE_ALWAYS` Requests for a URL that match this handler that do not use HTTPS are automatically redirected to the HTTPS URL with the same path. Query parameters are reserved for the redirect.
    * `SECURE_OPTIONAL` Both HTTP and HTTPS requests with URLs that match the handler succeed without redirects. The application can examine the request to determine which protocol was used and respond accordingly.

* `ingress_settings` - (Optional) String value that controls what traffic can reach the function. Allowed values are `ALLOW_ALL`, `ALLOW_INTERNAL_AND_GCLB` and `ALLOW_INTERNAL_ONLY`. Check [ingress documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/networking/network-settings#ingress_settings) to see the impact of each settings value. Changes to this field will recreate the cloud function.

* `source_archive_bucket` - (Optional) The GCS bucket containing the zip archive which contains the function.

* `source_archive_object` - (Optional) The source archive object (file) in archive bucket.

* `source_repository` - (Optional) Represents parameters related to source repository where a function is hosted.
  Cannot be set alongside `source_archive_bucket` or `source_archive_object`. Structure is [documented below](#nested_source_repository). It must match the pattern `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/repositories/{repository}`.* 

* `docker_registry` - (Optional) Docker Registry to use for storing the function's Docker images. Allowed values are CONTAINER_REGISTRY (default) and ARTIFACT_REGISTRY.

* `docker_repository` - (Optional) User managed repository created in Artifact Registry optionally with a customer managed encryption key. If specified, deployments will use Artifact Registry. This is the repository to which the function docker image will be pushed after it is built by Cloud Build. If unspecified, Container Registry will be used by default, unless specified otherwise by other means.

* `kms_key_name` - (Optional) Resource name of a KMS crypto key (managed by the user) used to encrypt/decrypt function resources. It must match the pattern `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto_key}`.

* `secret_environment_variables` - (Optional) Secret environment variables configuration. Structure is [documented below](#nested_secret_environment_variables).

* `secret_volumes` - (Optional) Secret volumes configuration. Structure is [documented below](#nested_secret_volumes).

<a name="nested_event_trigger"></a>The `event_trigger` block supports:

* `event_type` - (Required) The type of event to observe. For example: `"google.storage.object.finalize"`.
See the documentation on [calling Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/) for a
full reference of accepted triggers.

* `resource` - (Required) Required. The name or partial URI of the resource from
which to observe events. For example, `"myBucket"` or `"projects/my-project/topics/my-topic"`

<a name="nested_failure_policy"></a>The `failure_policy` block supports:

* `retry` - (Required) Whether the function should be retried on failure. Defaults to `false`.

<a name="nested_source_repository"></a>The `source_repository` block supports:

* `url` - (Required) The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function is defined. There are supported Cloud Source Repository URLs in the following formats:

    * To refer to a specific commit: `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/revisions/*/paths/*`
    * To refer to a moveable alias (branch): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/moveable-aliases/*/paths/*`. To refer to HEAD, use the `master` moveable alias.
    * To refer to a specific fixed alias (tag): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/fixed-aliases/*/paths/*`

<a name="nested_secret_environment_variables"></a>The `secret_environment_variables` block supports:

* `key` - (Required) Name of the environment variable.

* `project_id` - (Optional) Project identifier (due to a known limitation, only project number is supported by this field) of the project that contains the secret. If not set, it will be populated with the function's project, assuming that the secret exists in the same project as of the function.

* `secret` - (Required) ID of the secret in secret manager (not the full resource name).

* `version` - (Required) Version of the secret (version number or the string "latest"). It is recommended to use a numeric version for secret environment variables as any updates to the secret value is not reflected until new clones start.

<a name="nested_secret_volumes"></a>The `secret_volumes` block supports:

* `mount_path` - (Required) The path within the container to mount the secret volume. For example, setting the mount_path as "/etc/secrets" would mount the secret value files under the "/etc/secrets" directory. This directory will also be completely shadowed and unavailable to mount any other secrets. Recommended mount paths: "/etc/secrets" Restricted mount paths: "/cloudsql", "/dev/log", "/pod", "/proc", "/var/log".

* `project_id` - (Optional) Project identifier (due to a known limitation, only project number is supported by this field) of the project that contains the secret. If not set, it will be populated with the function's project, assuming that the secret exists in the same project as of the function.

* `secret` - (Required) ID of the secret in secret manager (not the full resource name).

* `versions` - (Optional) List of secret versions to mount for this secret. If empty, the "latest" version of the secret will be made available in a file named after the secret under the mount point. Structure is [documented below](#nested_nested_versions).

<a name="nested_versions"></a>The `versions` block supports:

* `path` - (Required) Relative path of the file under the mount path where the secret value for this version will be fetched and made available. For example, setting the mount_path as "/etc/secrets" and path as "/secret_foo" would mount the secret value file at "/etc/secrets/secret_foo".

* `version` - (Required) Version of the secret (version number or the string "latest"). It is preferable to use "latest" version with secret volumes as secret value changes are reflected immediately.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

* `https_trigger_url` - URL which triggers function execution. Returned only if `trigger_http` is used.

* `source_repository.0.deployed_url` - The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function was defined at the time of deployment.

* `project` - Project of the function. If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `region` - Region of function. If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
