# google\_cloudfunctions\_function

Creates a new Cloud Function. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/apis).

~> **Warning:** As of November 1, 2019, newly created Functions are
private-by-default and will require [appropriate IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/reference/iam/roles)
to be invoked. See below examples for how to set up the appropriate permissions,
or view the [Cloud Functions IAM resources](/docs/providers/google/r/cloudfunctions_cloud_function_iam.html)
for Cloud Functions.

## Example Usage - Public Function

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name = "test-bucket"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "archive" {
  name   = "index.zip"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source = "./path/to/zip/file/which/contains/code"
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function" "function" {
  name        = "function-test"
  description = "My function"
  runtime     = "nodejs10"

  available_memory_mb   = 128
  source_archive_bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source_archive_object = google_storage_bucket_object.archive.name
  trigger_http          = true
  entry_point           = "helloGET"
}

# IAM entry for all users to invoke the function
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "invoker" {
  project        = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.project
  region         = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.region
  cloud_function = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.name

  role   = "roles/cloudfunctions.invoker"
  member = "allUsers"
}
```

## Example Usage - Single User

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
  name = "test-bucket"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "archive" {
  name   = "index.zip"
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source = "./path/to/zip/file/which/contains/code"
}

resource "google_cloudfunctions_function" "function" {
  name        = "function-test"
  description = "My function"
  runtime     = "nodejs10"

  available_memory_mb   = 128
  source_archive_bucket = google_storage_bucket.bucket.name
  source_archive_object = google_storage_bucket_object.archive.name
  trigger_http          = true
  timeout               = 60
  entry_point           = "helloGET"
  labels = {
    my-label = "my-label-value"
  }

  environment_variables = {
    MY_ENV_VAR = "my-env-var-value"
  }
}

# IAM entry for a single user to invoke the function
resource "google_cloudfunctions_function_iam_member" "invoker" {
  project        = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.project
  region         = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.region
  cloud_function = google_cloudfunctions_function.function.name

  role   = "roles/cloudfunctions.invoker"
  member = "user:myFunctionInvoker@example.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique globally.

* `runtime` - (Required) The runtime in which the function is going to run.
Eg. `"nodejs8"`, `"nodejs10"`, `"python37"`, `"go111"`.

- - -

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the function.

* `available_memory_mb` - (Optional) Memory (in MB), available to the function. Default value is 256MB. Allowed values are: 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, 1024MB, and 2048MB.

* `timeout` - (Optional) Timeout (in seconds) for the function. Default value is 60 seconds. Cannot be more than 540 seconds.

* `entry_point` - (Optional) Name of the function that will be executed when the Google Cloud Function is triggered.

* `event_trigger` - (Optional) A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service. Structure is documented below. Cannot be used with `trigger_http`.

* `trigger_http` - (Optional) Boolean variable. Any HTTP request (of a supported type) to the endpoint will trigger function execution. Supported HTTP request types are: POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, and OPTIONS. Endpoint is returned as `https_trigger_url`. Cannot be used with `trigger_bucket` and `trigger_topic`.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the function.

* `service_account_email` - (Optional) If provided, the self-provided service account to run the function with.

* `environment_variables` - (Optional) A set of key/value environment variable pairs to assign to the function.

* `vpc_connector` - (Optional) The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network connector resource. The format of this field is `projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*`.

* `source_archive_bucket` - (Optional) The GCS bucket containing the zip archive which contains the function.

* `source_archive_object` - (Optional) The source archive object (file) in archive bucket.

* `source_repository` - (Optional) Represents parameters related to source repository where a function is hosted.
  Cannot be set alongside `source_archive_bucket` or `source_archive_object`. Structure is documented below.

* `max_instances` - (Optional) The limit on the maximum number of function instances that may coexist at a given time.

The `event_trigger` block supports:

* `event_type` - (Required) The type of event to observe. For example: `"google.storage.object.finalize"`.
See the documentation on [calling Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/) for a full reference.
Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Firestore triggers are supported at this time.
Legacy triggers are supported, such as `"providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change"`, 
`"providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish"` and `"providers/cloud.firestore/eventTypes/document.create"`.

* `resource` - (Required) Required. The name or partial URI of the resource from
which to observe events. For example, `"myBucket"` or `"projects/my-project/topics/my-topic"`

* `failure_policy` - (Optional) Specifies policy for failed executions. Structure is documented below.

The `failure_policy` block supports:

* `retry` - (Required) Whether the function should be retried on failure. Defaults to `false`.

The `source_repository` block supports:

* `url` - (Required) The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function is defined. There are supported Cloud Source Repository URLs in the following formats:

    * To refer to a specific commit: `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/revisions/*/paths/*`
    * To refer to a moveable alias (branch): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/moveable-aliases/*/paths/*`. To refer to HEAD, use the `master` moveable alias.
    * To refer to a specific fixed alias (tag): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/fixed-aliases/*/paths/*`

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `https_trigger_url` - URL which triggers function execution. Returned only if `trigger_http` is used.

* `source_repository.0.deployed_url` - The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function was defined at the time of deployment.

* `project` - Project of the function. If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `region` - Region of function. Currently can be only "us-central1". If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `update` - Default is 5 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 5 minutes.

## Import

Functions can be imported using the `name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_cloudfunctions_function.default function-test
```
