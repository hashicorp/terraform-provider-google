## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `routing` -
  (Required)
  Defines how requests are routed, modified, cached and/or which origin content is filled from.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_routing).

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
  The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]* which means the first character must be a letter,
  and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.


<a name="nested_routing"></a>The `routing` block supports:

* `host_rule` -
  (Required)
  The list of hostRules to match against. These rules define which hostnames the EdgeCacheService will match against, and which route configurations apply.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_host_rule).

* `path_matcher` -
  (Required)
  The list of pathMatchers referenced via name by hostRules. PathMatcher is used to match the path portion of the URL when a HostRule matches the URL's host portion.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_path_matcher).


<a name="nested_host_rule"></a>The `host_rule` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-readable description of the hostRule.

* `hosts` -
  (Required)
  The list of host patterns to match.
  Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). It does not match the empty string.
  When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:
    1. Exact domain names: ``www.foo.com``.
    2. Suffix domain wildcards: ``*.foo.com`` or ``*-bar.foo.com``.
    3. Prefix domain wildcards: ``foo.*`` or ``foo-*``.
    4. Special wildcard ``*`` matching any domain.
    Notes:
      The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. ``*-bar.foo.com`` will match ``baz-bar.foo.com`` but not ``-bar.foo.com``. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single host in the entire service can match on ``*``. A domain must be unique across all configured hosts within a service.
      Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.
      You may specify up to 10 hosts.

* `path_matcher` -
  (Required)
  The name of the pathMatcher associated with this hostRule.

<a name="nested_path_matcher"></a>The `path_matcher` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-readable description of the resource.

* `route_rule` -
  (Required)
  The routeRules to match against. routeRules support advanced routing behaviour, and can match on paths, headers and query parameters, as well as status codes and HTTP methods.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_route_rule).


<a name="nested_route_rule"></a>The `route_rule` block supports:

* `priority` -
  (Required)
  The priority of this route rule, where 1 is the highest priority.
  You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999 inclusive.
  Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
  to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-readable description of the routeRule.

* `match_rule` -
  (Required)
  The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates
  within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_match_rule).

* `header_action` -
  (Optional)
  The header actions, including adding & removing headers, for requests that match this route.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_header_action).

* `route_action` -
  (Optional)
  In response to a matching path, the routeAction performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected origin.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_route_action).

* `origin` -
  (Optional)
  The Origin resource that requests to this route should fetch from when a matching response is not in cache. Origins can be defined as short names ("my-origin") or fully-qualified resource URLs - e.g. "networkservices.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/global/edgecacheorigins/my-origin"
  Only one of origin or urlRedirect can be set.

* `url_redirect` -
  (Optional)
  The URL redirect configuration for requests that match this route.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_url_redirect).


<a name="nested_match_rule"></a>The `match_rule` block supports:

* `ignore_case` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case sensitive.

* `header_match` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which must match corresponding headers in the request.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_header_match).

* `query_parameter_match` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria, all of which must match corresponding query parameters in the request.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_query_parameter_match).

* `prefix_match` -
  (Optional)
  For satisfying the matchRule condition, the request's path must begin with the specified prefixMatch. prefixMatch must begin with a /.

* `path_template_match` -
  (Optional)
  For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request
  must match the wildcard pattern specified in pathTemplateMatch
  after removing any query parameters and anchor that may be part
  of the original URL.
  pathTemplateMatch must be between 1 and 255 characters
  (inclusive).  The pattern specified by pathTemplateMatch may
  have at most 5 wildcard operators and at most 5 variable
  captures in total.

* `full_path_match` -
  (Optional)
  For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must exactly match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any query parameters and anchor that may be part of the original URL.


<a name="nested_header_match"></a>The `header_match` block supports:

* `header_name` -
  (Required)
  The header name to match on.

* `present_match` -
  (Optional)
  A header with the contents of headerName must exist. The match takes place whether or not the request's header has a value.

* `exact_match` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the header should exactly match contents of exactMatch.

* `prefix_match` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the header must start with the contents of prefixMatch.

* `suffix_match` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the header must end with the contents of suffixMatch.

* `invert_match` -
  (Optional)
  If set to false (default), the headerMatch is considered a match if the match criteria above are met.

<a name="nested_cdn_policy"></a>The `cdn_policy` block supports:

* `cache_mode` -
  (Optional)
  Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all responses.
  For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
  Possible values are: `CACHE_ALL_STATIC`, `USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS`, `FORCE_CACHE_ALL`, `BYPASS_CACHE`.

* `client_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) TTL, separate from the TTL used by the edge caches. Leaving this empty will use the same cache TTL for both the CDN and the client-facing response.
  - The TTL must be > 0 and <= 86400s (1 day)
  - The clientTtl cannot be larger than the defaultTtl (if set)
  - Fractions of a second are not allowed.
  Omit this field to use the defaultTtl, or the max-age set by the origin, as the client-facing TTL.
  When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
  A duration in seconds terminated by 's'. Example: "3s".

* `default_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age).
  Defaults to 3600s (1 hour).
  - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year)
  - Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" (equivalent to must-revalidate)
  - The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL.
  - Fractions of a second are not allowed.
  - When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses.
  Note that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL. Objects that expire will be revalidated with the origin.
  When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
  A duration in seconds terminated by 's'. Example: "3s".

* `max_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.
  Defaults to 86400s (1 day).
  Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTtl seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive.
  - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year)
  - Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate"
  - The value of maxTtl must be equal to or greater than defaultTtl.
  - Fractions of a second are not allowed.
  When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS", "FORCE_CACHE_ALL", or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.

* `cache_key_policy` -
  (Optional)
  Defines the request parameters that contribute to the cache key.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_cache_key_policy).

* `negative_caching` -
  (Optional)
  Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
  By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
  - HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
  - HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s
  - HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 414 (URI Too Long), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s
  These defaults can be overridden in negativeCachingPolicy

* `negative_caching_policy` -
  (Optional)
  Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure negativeCachingPolicy.
  - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in negativeCaching.
  - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate") and <= 86400s (1 day)
  Note that when specifying an explicit negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. The CDNPolicy will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.

* `signed_request_mode` -
  (Optional)
  Whether to enforce signed requests. The default value is DISABLED, which means all content is public, and does not authorize access.
  You must also set a signedRequestKeyset to enable signed requests.
  When set to REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests will have their signature validated. Requests that were not signed with the corresponding private key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired, do not match the signature, IP address, or header) will be rejected with a HTTP 403 and (if enabled) logged.
  Possible values are: `DISABLED`, `REQUIRE_SIGNATURES`, `REQUIRE_TOKENS`.

* `signed_request_keyset` -
  (Optional)
  The EdgeCacheKeyset containing the set of public keys used to validate signed requests at the edge.

* `signed_token_options` -
  (Optional)
  Additional options for signed tokens.
  signedTokenOptions may only be specified when signedRequestMode is REQUIRE_TOKENS.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_signed_token_options).

* `add_signatures` -
  (Optional)
  Enable signature generation or propagation on this route.
  This field may only be specified when signedRequestMode is set to REQUIRE_TOKENS.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_add_signatures).

* `signed_request_maximum_expiration_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  Limit how far into the future the expiration time of a signed request may be.
  When set, a signed request is rejected if its expiration time is later than now + signedRequestMaximumExpirationTtl, where now is the time at which the signed request is first handled by the CDN.
  - The TTL must be > 0.
  - Fractions of a second are not allowed.
  By default, signedRequestMaximumExpirationTtl is not set and the expiration time of a signed request may be arbitrarily far into future.


<a name="nested_cache_key_policy"></a>The `cache_key_policy` block supports:

* `include_protocol` -
  (Optional)
  If true, http and https requests will be cached separately.

* `exclude_query_string` -
  (Optional)
  If true, exclude query string parameters from the cache key
  If false (the default), include the query string parameters in
  the cache key according to includeQueryParameters and
  excludeQueryParameters. If neither includeQueryParameters nor
  excludeQueryParameters is set, the entire query string will be
  included.

* `exclude_host` -
  (Optional)
  If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately.
  Note: this should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content. Removing the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user matched.

* `included_query_parameters` -
  (Optional)

  - Header field names are case insensitive
  - To include the HTTP method, use ":method"
  Note that specifying several headers, and/or headers that have a large range of values (e.g. per-user) will dramatically impact the cache hit rate, and may result in a higher eviction rate and reduced performance.

* `included_cookie_names` -
  (Optional)
  Names of Cookies to include in cache keys.  The cookie name and cookie value of each cookie named will be used as part of the cache key.
  Cookie names:
    - must be valid RFC 6265 "cookie-name" tokens
    - are case sensitive
    - cannot start with "Edge-Cache-" (case insensitive)
    Note that specifying several cookies, and/or cookies that have a large range of values (e.g., per-user) will dramatically impact the cache hit rate, and may result in a higher eviction rate and reduced performance.

  This must be specified when the GENERATE_COOKIE or GENERATE_TOKEN_HLS_COOKIELESS actions are specified.  This field may not be specified otherwise.

* `token_ttl` -
  (Optional)
  The duration the token is valid starting from the moment the token is first generated.
  Defaults to `86400s` (1 day).
  The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 604,800 seconds (1 week).

  - A maximum TTL of 86400s can be set, but note that (as above) some clients may force pre-flight checks at a more regular interval.
  - This translates to the Access-Control-Max-Age header.
  A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".

* `allow_credentials` -
  (Optional)
  In response to a preflight request, setting this to true indicates that the actual request can include user credentials.
  This translates to the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header.
