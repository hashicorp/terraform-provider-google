# google\_cloud\_identity\_group\_membership

A Membership defines a relationship between a Group and an entity belonging to that Group, referred to as a "member".


To get more information about GroupMembership, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups.memberships)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/how-to/memberships-google-groups)

~> **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
in the provider configuration. Otherwise the Cloud Identity API will return a 403 error.
Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
`billing_project` you defined.

## Example Usage - Cloud Identity Group Membership


```hcl
resource "google_cloud_identity_group" "group" {
  display_name = "my-identity-group"

  parent = "customers/A01b123xz"

  group_key {
  	id = "my-identity-group@example.com"
  }

  labels = {
    "cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum" = ""
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_identity_group" "child-group" {
  display_name = "my-identity-group-child"

  parent = "customers/A01b123xz"

  group_key {
  	id = "my-identity-group-child@example.com"
  }

  labels = {
    "cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum" = ""
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_identity_group_membership" "cloud_identity_group_membership_basic" {
  group    = google_cloud_identity_group.group.id

  preferred_member_key {
    id = google_cloud_identity_group.child-group.group_key[0].id
  }

  roles {
  	name = "MEMBER"
  }
}
```
