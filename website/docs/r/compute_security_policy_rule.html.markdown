  * rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set.
  * redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR.
  * throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set for this.

* `security_policy` -
  (Required)
