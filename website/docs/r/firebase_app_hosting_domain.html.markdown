  (Required)
  The location of the Backend that this Domain is associated with

* `backend` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the Backend that this Domain is associated with

* `domain_id` -
  (Required)
  Id of the domain to create.
  Must be a valid domain name, such as "foo.com"

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_serve).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


<a name="nested_serve"></a>The `serve` block supports:

  (Optional)
  The status code to use in a redirect response. Must be a valid HTTP 3XX
  status code. Defaults to 302 if not present.

## Import


Domain can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/domains/{{domain_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Domain using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/domains/{{domain_id}}"
  to = google_firebase_app_hosting_domain.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Domain can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_domain.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/domains/{{domain_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_domain.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_domain.default {{location}}/{{backend}}/{{domain_id}}
```
