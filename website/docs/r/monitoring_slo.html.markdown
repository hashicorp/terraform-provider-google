# google\_monitoring\_slo

A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes the level of desired good
service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance
goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against
that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners.
Typical SLOs might include "99% of requests in each rolling week have
latency below 200 milliseconds" or "99.5% of requests in each calendar
month return successfully."


To get more information about Slo, see:

  The provided TimeSeries must have ValueType = INT64 or
  ValueType = DOUBLE and MetricKind = GAUGE. Mean value `X`
  should satisfy `range.min <= X <= range.max`
  under good service.

* `range` -
  (Required)
  Range of numerical values. The computed good_service
  will be the count of values x in the Distribution such
  that range.min <= x <= range.max. inclusive of min and
  max. Open ranges can be defined by setting
  just one of min or max. Mean value `X` of `time_series`
  values should satisfy `range.min <= X <= range.max` for a
  good service.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_range).


<a name="nested_range"></a>The `range` block supports:

* `min` -
  (Optional)
  Min value for the range (inclusive). If not given,
  will be set to "-infinity", defining an open range
  "< range.max"

* `max` -
  (Optional)
  max value for the range (inclusive). If not given,
  will be set to "infinity", defining an open range
  ">= range.min"
