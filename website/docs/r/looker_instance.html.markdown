  (Required)
  The ID of the instance or a fully qualified identifier for the instance.


- - -


* `admin_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Looker instance Admin settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_admin_settings).

* `consumer_network` -
  (Optional)
  Network name in the consumer project in the format of: projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}
  Note that the consumer network may be in a different GCP project than the consumer
  project that is hosting the Looker Instance.

  Looker instance encryption settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_encryption_config).

* `maintenance_window` -
  (Optional)
  Maintenance window for an instance.
  Maintenance of your instance takes place once a month, and will require
  your instance to be restarted during updates, which will temporarily
  disrupt service.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_maintenance_window).

* `oauth_config` -
  (Optional)
  Looker Instance OAuth login settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_oauth_config).

* `platform_edition` -
  (Optional)
  Platform editions for a Looker instance. Each edition maps to a set of instance features, like its size. Must be one of these values:
  - LOOKER_CORE_TRIAL: trial instance
  - LOOKER_CORE_STANDARD: pay as you go standard instance
  - LOOKER_CORE_STANDARD_ANNUAL: subscription standard instance
