Manages a VM instance resource within GCE. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
  name         = "test"
  machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"

  tags = ["foo", "bar"]

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  // Local SSD disk
  scratch_disk {
    interface = "SCSI"
  }

  network_interface {
    network = "default"

    access_config {
      // Ephemeral IP
    }
  }

  metadata = {
    foo = "bar"
  }

  metadata_startup_script = "echo hi > /test.txt"

  service_account {
    scopes = ["userinfo-email", "compute-ro", "storage-ro"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `boot_disk` - (Required) The boot disk for the instance.
    Structure is documented below.

* `machine_type` - (Required) The machine type to create.

    **Note:** If you want to update this value (resize the VM) after initial creation, you must set [`allow_stopping_for_update`](#allow_stopping_for_update) to `true`.

    [Custom machine types][custom-vm-types] can be formatted as `custom-NUMBER_OF_CPUS-AMOUNT_OF_MEMORY_MB`, e.g. `custom-6-20480` for 6 vCPU and 20GB of RAM.

    There is a limit of 6.5 GB per CPU unless you add [extended memory][extended-custom-vm-type]. You must do this explicitly by adding the suffix `-ext`, e.g. `custom-2-15360-ext` for 2 vCPU and 15 GB of memory.

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `zone` - (Required) The zone that the machine should be created in.

* `network_interface` - (Required) Networks to attach to the instance. This can
    be specified multiple times. Structure is documented below.

- - -

* `allow_stopping_for_update` - (Optional) If true, allows Terraform to stop the instance to update its properties.
  If you try to update a property that requires stopping the instance without setting this field, the update will fail.

* `attached_disk` - (Optional) Additional disks to attach to the instance. Can be repeated multiple times for multiple disks. Structure is documented below.

* `can_ip_forward` - (Optional) Whether to allow sending and receiving of
    packets with non-matching source or destination IPs.
    This defaults to false.

* `description` - (Optional) A brief description of this resource.

* `deletion_protection` - (Optional) Enable deletion protection on this instance. Defaults to false.
    **Note:** you must disable deletion protection before removing the resource (e.g., via `terraform destroy`), or the instance cannot be deleted and the Terraform run will not complete successfully.

* `hostname` - (Optional) A custom hostname for the instance. Must be a fully qualified DNS name and RFC-1035-valid.
  Valid format is a series of labels 1-63 characters long matching the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])`, concatenated with periods.
  The entire hostname must not exceed 253 characters. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `guest_accelerator` - (Optional) List of the type and count of accelerator cards attached to the instance. Structure documented below.
    **Note:** GPU accelerators can only be used with [`on_host_maintenance`](#on_host_maintenance) option set to TERMINATE.

* `labels` - (Optional) A map of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.

* `metadata` - (Optional) Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
    within the instance. Ssh keys attached in the Cloud Console will be removed.
    Add them to your config in order to keep them attached to your instance.

-> On import, `metadata_startup_script` will be set while 
`metadata.startup-script` will not be. You'll need to match 
`metadata_startup_script` to your `startup-script` value.

* `metadata_startup_script` - (Optional) An alternative to using the
    startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be
    recreated (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the
    startup-script metadata key on the created instance and thus the two
    mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.

* `min_cpu_platform` - (Optional) Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the VM instance. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
`Intel Haswell` or `Intel Skylake`. See the complete list [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform).
    **Note**: [`allow_stopping_for_update`](#allow_stopping_for_update) must be set to true in order to update this field.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `scheduling` - (Optional) The scheduling strategy to use. More details about
    this configuration option are detailed below.

* `scratch_disk` - (Optional) Scratch disks to attach to the instance. This can be
    specified multiple times for multiple scratch disks. Structure is documented below.

* `service_account` - (Optional) Service account to attach to the instance.
    Structure is documented below.
    **Note**: [`allow_stopping_for_update`](#allow_stopping_for_update) must be set to true in order to update this field.

* `tags` - (Optional) A list of tags to attach to the instance.

* `shielded_instance_config` - (Optional) Enable [Shielded VM](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm) on this instance. Shielded VM provides verifiable integrity to prevent against malware and rootkits. Defaults to disabled. Structure is documented below.
	**Note**: [`shielded_instance_config`](#shielded_instance_config) can only be used with boot images with shielded vm support. See the complete list [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#shielded-images).

* `enable_display` - (Optional) Enable [Virtual Displays](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-instance-virtual-display#verify_display_driver) on this instance.
**Note**: [`allow_stopping_for_update`](#allow_stopping_for_update) must be set to true in order to update this field.
