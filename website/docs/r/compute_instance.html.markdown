# google\_compute\_instance

Manages a VM instance resource within GCE. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
  name         = "test"
  machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"

  tags = ["foo", "bar"]

  disk {
    image = "debian-cloud/debian-8"
  }

  // Local SSD disk
  disk {
    type    = "local-ssd"
    scratch = true
  }

  network_interface {
    network = "default"

    access_config {
      // Ephemeral IP
    }
  }

  metadata {
    foo = "bar"
  }

  metadata_startup_script = "echo hi > /test.txt"

  service_account {
    scopes = ["userinfo-email", "compute-ro", "storage-ro"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `boot_disk` - (Required) The boot disk for the instance.
    Structure is documented below.

* `machine_type` - (Required) The machine type to create. To create a custom
    machine type, value should be set as specified
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances#machineType)

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `zone` - (Required) The zone that the machine should be created in.

* `network_interface` - (Required) Networks to attach to the instance. This can
    be specified multiple times for multiple networks, but GCE is currently
    limited to just 1. Structure is documented below.

- - -

* `scratch_disk` - (Optional) Scratch disks to attach to the instance. This can be
    specified multiple times for multiple scratch disks. Structure is documented below.

* `can_ip_forward` - (Optional) Whether to allow sending and receiving of
    packets with non-matching source or destination IPs.
    This defaults to false.

* `create_timeout` - (Optional) Configurable timeout in minutes for creating instances. Default is 4 minutes.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `description` - (Optional) A brief description of this resource.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.

* `metadata` - (Optional) Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
    within the instance.

* `metadata_startup_script` - (Optional) An alternative to using the
    startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be
    recreated (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the
    startup-script metadata key on the created instance and thus the two
    mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `scheduling` - (Optional) The scheduling strategy to use. More details about
    this configuration option are detailed below.

* `service_account` - (Optional) Service account to attach to the instance.
    Structure is documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A list of tags to attach to the instance.

---

* `disk` - (DEPRECATED) Disks to attach to the instance. This can be specified
    multiple times for multiple disks. Structure is documented below.

* `network` - (DEPRECATED) Networks to attach to the instance. This
    can be specified multiple times for multiple networks. Structure is
    documented below.

    alongside the new instance. Either `initialize_params` or `source` must be set.
    Structure is documented below.

* `source` - (Optional) The name of the existing disk (such as those managed by
    `google_compute_disk`) to attach.

The `initialize_params` block supports:

* `size` - (Optional) The size of the image in gigabytes. If not specified, it
    will inherit the size of its base image.

* `type` - (Optional) The GCE disk type. May be set to pd-standard or pd-ssd.

* `image` - (Optional) The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be
    one of: the image's `self_link`, `projects/{project}/global/images/{image}`,
    `projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}`, `global/images/{image}`,
    `global/images/family/{family}`, `family/{family}`, `{project}/{family}`,
    `{project}/{image}`, `{family}`, or `{image}`.

The `scratch_disk` block supports:

* `interface` - (Optional) The disk interface to use for attaching this disk; either SCSI or NVME.
    Defaults to SCSI.

(DEPRECATED) The `disk` block supports: (Note that either disk or image is required, unless
the type is "local-ssd", in which case scratch must be true).

* `disk` - The name of the existing disk (such as those managed by
    `google_compute_disk`) to attach.

* `image` - The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be
    one of: the image's `self_link`, `projects/{project}/global/images/{image}`,

    `global/images/family/{family}`, `family/{family}`, `{project}/{family}`,
    `{project}/{image}`, `{family}`, or `{image}`.

* `auto_delete` - (Optional) Whether or not the disk should be auto-deleted.

* `type` - (Optional) The GCE disk type, e.g. pd-standard, pd-ssd, or local-ssd.

* `scratch` - (Optional) Whether the disk is a scratch disk as opposed to a
    persistent disk (required for local-ssd).

* `size` - (Optional) The size of the image in gigabytes. If not specified, it
    will inherit the size of its base image. Do not specify for local SSDs as
    their size is fixed.

* `access_config` - (Optional) Access configurations, i.e. IPs via which this
    instance can be accessed via the Internet. Omit to ensure that the instance
    is not accessible from the Internet (this means that ssh provisioners will
    not work unless you are running Terraform can send traffic to the instance's
    network (e.g. via tunnel or because it is running on another cloud instance
    on that network). This block can be repeated multiple times. Structure
    documented below.

The `access_config` block supports:
