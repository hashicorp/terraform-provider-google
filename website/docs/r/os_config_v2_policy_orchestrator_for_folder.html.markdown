# google_os_config_v2_policy_orchestrator_for_folder

PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g.
OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them
across projects and locations, at scale.



## Example Usage - Osconfigv2 Policy Orchestrator For Folder Basic


```hcl

<a name="nested_orchestrated_resource"></a>The `orchestrated_resource` block supports:

* `os_policy_assignment_v1_payload` -
  (Optional)
  OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to
  apply a set of OS policies to a dynamically targeted group of Compute Engine
  VM instances.
  An OS policy is used to define the desired state configuration for a
  Compute Engine VM instance through a set of configuration resources that
  provide capabilities such as installing or removing software packages, or
  executing a script.
  For more information about the OS policy resource definitions and examples,
  see
  [OS policy and OS policy
  assignment](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-configuration-management/working-with-os-policies).
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload).

* `id` -
  (Optional)
  ID of the resource to be used while generating set of affected resources.
  For UPSERT action the value is auto-generated during PolicyOrchestrator
  creation when not set. When the value is set it should following next
  restrictions:
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  * Must start with a letter.
  * Must be between 1-63 characters.
  * Must end with a number or a letter.
  * Must be unique within the project.
  For DELETE action, ID must be specified explicitly during
  PolicyOrchestrator creation.

  OS policy assignment description.
  Length of the description is limited to 1024 characters.

* `os_policies` -
  (Required)
  List of OS policies to be applied to the VMs.

* `revision_id` -
  (Output)
  The assignment revision ID
  A new revision is committed whenever a rollout is triggered for a OS policy
  assignment

* `baseline` -
  (Output)
  Indicates that this revision has been successfully rolled out in this zone

  For a given OS policy assignment, there is only one revision with a value
  of `true` for this field.

* `deleted` -
  (Output)
  Indicates that this revision deletes the OS policy assignment.

* `rollout` -
  (Required)
  Message to configure the rollout at the zonal level for the OS policy

  OS policy assignment rollout state
  Possible values:
  IN_PROGRESS
  CANCELLING
  CANCELLED
  SUCCEEDED

* `mode` -
  (Required)
  Policy mode
  Possible values are: `VALIDATION`, `ENFORCEMENT`.

* `resource_groups` -
  (Required)
  List of resource groups for the policy.
  For a particular VM, resource groups are evaluated in the order specified
  and the first resource group that is applicable is selected and the rest
  are ignored.
  If none of the resource groups are applicable for a VM, the VM is
  considered to be non-compliant w.r.t this policy. This behavior can be
  toggled by the flag `allow_no_resource_group_match`
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups).

* `allow_no_resource_group_match` -
  (Optional)
  This flag determines the OS policy compliance status when none of the
  resource groups within the policy are applicable for a VM. Set this value
  to `true` if the policy needs to be reported as compliant even if the
  policy has nothing to validate or enforce.


<a name="nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups"></a>The `resource_groups` block supports:

* `inventory_filters` -
  (Optional)
  List of inventory filters for the resource group.
  The resources in this resource group are applied to the target VM if it
  satisfies at least one of the following inventory filters.
  For example, to apply this resource group to VMs running either `RHEL` or
  `CentOS` operating systems, specify 2 items for the list with following
  values:
  inventory_filters[0].os_short_name='rhel' and
  inventory_filters[1].os_short_name='centos'
  If the list is empty, this resource group will be applied to the target
  VM unconditionally.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_inventory_filters).

* `resources` -
  (Required)
  List of resources configured for this resource group.
  The resources are executed in the exact order specified here.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_resources).


<a name="nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_inventory_filters"></a>The `inventory_filters` block supports:

* `os_short_name` -
  (Required)
  The OS short name

* `os_version` -
  (Optional)
  The OS version
  Prefix matches are supported if asterisk(*) is provided as the
  last character. For example, to match all versions with a major
  version of `7`, specify the following value for this field `7.*`
  An empty string matches all OS versions.

<a name="nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_resources"></a>The `resources` block supports:

* `id` -
  (Required)
  The id of the resource with the following restrictions:
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  * Must start with a letter.
  * Must be between 1-63 characters.
  * Must end with a number or a letter.
  * Must be unique within the OS policy.

* `pkg` -
  (Optional)
  A resource that manages a system package.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_resources_resources_pkg).

* `repository` -
  (Optional)
  A resource that manages a package repository.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_orchestrated_resource_os_policy_assignment_v1_payload_os_policies_os_policies_resource_groups_resource_groups_resources_resources_repository).

* `exec` -
  (Optional)
  A resource that allows executing scripts on the VM.
  The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages
  accept a script as an argument to execute.
  When the `ExecResource` is applied by the agent, it first executes the
  script in the `validate` stage. The `validate` stage can signal that the
  `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code
  of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should
  return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage
  is considered an error.
  If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code
  from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from
  the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired
  state, the `enforce` stage will not be run.
  Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit
  code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state.
  Any other exit code is considered an error.
  NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to
  have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state`
  and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit
  code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script. So, for
  reasons of consistency and being explicit, exit codes `100` and `101`
  were chosen.
