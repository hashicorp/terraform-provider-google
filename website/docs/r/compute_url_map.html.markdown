# google\_compute\_url\_map

UrlMaps are used to route requests to a backend service based on rules
that you define for the host and path of an incoming URL.


To get more information about UrlMap, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The
  name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the
  name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
  `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase
  letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
  except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `default_service` -
  (Optional)
  The backend service or backend bucket to use when none of the given rules match.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
  the resource.

* `header_action` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
  the selected backendService. The headerAction specified here take effect after
  headerAction specified under pathMatcher.  Structure is documented below.

* `host_rule` -
  (Optional)
  The list of HostRules to use against the URL.  Structure is documented below.

* `path_matcher` -
  (Optional)
  The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.  Structure is documented below.

* `test` -
  (Optional)
  The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update this UrlMap will
  succeed only if all of the test cases pass. You can specify a maximum of 100
  tests per UrlMap.  Structure is documented below.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `header_action` block supports:

* `request_headers_to_add` -
  (Optional)
  Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the
  backendService.  Structure is documented below.

* `request_headers_to_remove` -
  (Optional)
  A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request
  prior to forwarding the request to the backendService.

* `response_headers_to_add` -
  (Optional)
  Headers to add the response prior to sending the response back to the client.  Structure is documented below.

* `response_headers_to_remove` -
  (Optional)
  A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
  prior to sending the response back to the client.


The `request_headers_to_add` block supports:

* `header_name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the header.

* `header_value` -
  (Required)
  The value of the header to add.

* `replace` -
  (Required)
  If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
  header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
  were set for that header.

The `response_headers_to_add` block supports:

* `header_name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the header.

* `header_value` -
  (Required)
  The value of the header to add.

* `replace` -
  (Required)
  If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
  header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
  were set for that header.

The `host_rule` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
  the resource.

* `hosts` -
  (Required)
  The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except * will
  match any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). In that case, * must be the first character
  and must be followed in the pattern by either - or ..

* `path_matcher` -
  (Required)
  The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of the URL if the
  hostRule matches the URL's host portion.

The `path_matcher` block supports:

* `default_service` -
  (Optional)
  The backend service or backend bucket to use when none of the given paths match.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create
  the resource.

* `header_action` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for
  the selected backendService. HeaderAction specified here are applied after the
  matching HttpRouteRule HeaderAction and before the HeaderAction in the UrlMap  Structure is documented below.

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.

* `path_rule` -
  (Optional)
  The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
  on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
  are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
  basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
  irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
  given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.  Structure is documented below.

* `route_rules` -
  (Optional)
  The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
  advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
  routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
  action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
  routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
  External load balancers.  Structure is documented below.


The `header_action` block supports:

* `request_headers_to_add` -
  (Optional)
  Headers to add to a matching request prior to forwarding the request to the
  backendService.  Structure is documented below.

* `request_headers_to_remove` -
  (Optional)
  A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request
  prior to forwarding the request to the backendService.

* `response_headers_to_add` -
  (Optional)
  Headers to add the response prior to sending the response back to the client.  Structure is documented below.

* `response_headers_to_remove` -
  (Optional)
  A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
  prior to sending the response back to the client.


The `request_headers_to_add` block supports:

* `header_name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the header.

* `header_value` -
  (Required)
  The value of the header to add.

* `replace` -

    streams.
  - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
    502, 503 or 504.

    header is set to cancelled
  - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
