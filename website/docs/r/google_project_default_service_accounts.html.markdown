# google_project_default_service_accounts

Allows management of Google Cloud Platform project default service accounts.

When certain service APIs are enabled, Google Cloud Platform automatically creates service accounts to help get started, but
this is not recommended for production environments as per [Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#default).
See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.

~> **WARNING** Some Google Cloud products do not work if the default service accounts are deleted so it is better to `DEPRIVILEGE` as
Google **CAN NOT** recover service accounts that have been deleted for more than 30 days.
Also Google recommends using the `constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts` [constraint](/docs/providers/google/r/google_organization_policy.html)
to disable automatic IAM Grants to default service accounts.

~> This resource works on a best-effort basis, as no API formally describes the default service accounts
and it is for users who are unable to use constraints. If the default service accounts change their name
or additional service accounts are added, this resource will need to be updated.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_project_default_service_accounts" "my_project" {
  project = "my-project-id"
  action = "DELETE"
}
```

To enable the default service accounts on the resource destroy:

```hcl
resource "google_project_default_service_accounts" "my_project" {
  project = "my-project-id"
  action = "DISABLE"
  restore_policy = "REVERT"
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `project` - (Required) The project ID where service accounts are created.

- `action` - (Required) The action to be performed in the default service accounts. Valid values are: `DEPRIVILEGE`, `DELETE`, `DISABLE`. Note that `DEPRIVILEGE` action will ignore the REVERT configuration in the restore_policy

- `restore_policy` - (Optional) The action to be performed in the default service accounts on the resource destroy.
  Valid values are NONE, REVERT and REVERT_AND_IGNORE_FAILURE. It is applied for any action but in the DEPRIVILEGE.
  If set to REVERT it attempts to restore all default SAs but the DEPRIVILEGE action.
  If set to REVERT_AND_IGNORE_FAILURE it is the same behavior as REVERT but ignores errors returned by the API.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

- `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}`
- `service_accounts` - The Service Accounts changed by this resource. It is used for `REVERT` the `action` on the destroy.
