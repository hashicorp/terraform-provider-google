# google\_dns\_policy

A policy is a collection of DNS rules applied to one or more Virtual
Private Cloud resources.


To get more information about Policy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/reference/v1beta2/policies)
* How-to Guides
    * [Using DNS server policies](https://cloud.google.com/dns/zones/#using-dns-server-policies)

## Example Usage - Dns Policy Basic


```hcl
resource "google_dns_policy" "example-policy" {
  name                      = "example-policy"
  enable_inbound_forwarding = true

  enable_logging = true

  alternative_name_server_config {
    target_name_servers {
      ipv4_address    = "172.16.1.10"
      forwarding_path = "private"
    }
    target_name_servers {
      ipv4_address = "172.16.1.20"
    }
  }

  networks {
    network_url = google_compute_network.network-1.id
  }
  networks {
    network_url = google_compute_network.network-2.id
  }
}

resource "google_compute_network" "network-1" {
  name                    = "network-1"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_network" "network-2" {
  name                    = "network-2"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  User assigned name for this policy.


- - -


* `alternative_name_server_config` -
  (Optional)
  Sets an alternative name server for the associated networks.
  When specified, all DNS queries are forwarded to a name server that you choose.
  Names such as .internal are not available when an alternative name server is specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_alternative_name_server_config).

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A textual description field. Defaults to 'Managed by Terraform'.

* `enable_inbound_forwarding` -
  (Optional)
  Allows networks bound to this policy to receive DNS queries sent
  by VMs or applications over VPN connections. When enabled, a
  virtual IP address will be allocated from each of the sub-networks
  that are bound to this policy.

* `enable_logging` -
  (Optional)
  Controls whether logging is enabled for the networks bound to this policy.
  Defaults to no logging if not set.

* `networks` -
  (Optional)
  List of network names specifying networks to which this policy is applied.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_networks).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_alternative_name_server_config"></a>The `alternative_name_server_config` block supports:

* `target_name_servers` -
  (Required)
  Sets an alternative name server for the associated networks. When specified,
  all DNS queries are forwarded to a name server that you choose. Names such as .internal
  are not available when an alternative name server is specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target_name_servers).


<a name="nested_target_name_servers"></a>The `target_name_servers` block supports:

* `ipv4_address` -
  (Required)
  IPv4 address to forward to.

* `forwarding_path` -
  (Optional)
  Forwarding path for this TargetNameServer. If unset or `default` Cloud DNS will make forwarding
  decision based on address ranges, i.e. RFC1918 addresses go to the VPC, Non-RFC1918 addresses go
  to the Internet. When set to `private`, Cloud DNS will always send queries through VPC for this target
  Possible values are `default` and `private`.

<a name="nested_networks"></a>The `networks` block supports:

* `network_url` -
  (Required)
  The id or fully qualified URL of the VPC network to forward queries to.
  This should be formatted like `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or
  `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/policies/{{name}}`


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Policy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_dns_policy.default projects/{{project}}/policies/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_dns_policy.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_dns_policy.default {{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides
