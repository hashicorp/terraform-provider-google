# google_iap_client

Contains the data that describes an Identity Aware Proxy owned client.

~> **Note:** Only internal org clients can be created via declarative tools. External clients must be
manually created via the GCP console. This restriction is due to the existing APIs and not lack of support
in this tool.


To get more information about Client, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.brands.identityAwareProxyClients)
* How-to Guides
    * [Setting up IAP Client](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `secret`.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

}

resource "google_project_service" "project_service" {
  project = google_project.project.project_id
  service = "iap.googleapis.com"
}

resource "google_iap_brand" "project_brand" {
  support_email     = "support@example.com"
  application_title = "Cloud IAP protected Application"
  project           = google_project_service.project_service.project
}

## Import


Client can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{brand}}/identityAwareProxyClients/{{client_id}}`
* `{{brand}}/{{client_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Client using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{brand}}/identityAwareProxyClients/{{client_id}}"
  to = google_iap_client.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Client can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_iap_client.default {{brand}}/identityAwareProxyClients/{{client_id}}
$ terraform import google_iap_client.default {{brand}}/{{client_id}}
```
