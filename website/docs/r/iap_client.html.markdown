# google\_iap\_client

Contains the data that describes an Identity Aware Proxy owned client.

~> **Note:** Only internal org clients can be created via declarative tools. External clients must be
manually created via the GCP console. This restriction is due to the existing APIs and not lack of support
in this tool.


To get more information about Client, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.brands.identityAwareProxyClients)
* How-to Guides
    * [Setting up IAP Client](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `secret`.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).
