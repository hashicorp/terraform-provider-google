  Max number of findings that will be returned for each item scanned. The maximum returned is 2000.

  not have an infoType, the DLP API applies the limit against all infoTypes that are found but not
  specified in another InfoTypeLimit.
  Structure is documented below.

* `max_findings` -
  (Required)
  Max findings limit for the given infoType.


The `info_type` block supports:

  at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

The `info_types` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed
  at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

The `rule_set` block supports:

* `info_types` -
  (Required)
  List of infoTypes this rule set is applied to.

  Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed
  at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type.

The `rules` block supports:

* `hotword_rule` -
  (Optional)
  Hotword-based detection rule.
  Structure is documented below.

* `exclusion_rule` -

  The rule that specifies conditions when findings of infoTypes specified in InspectionRuleSet are removed from results.
  Structure is documented below.


The `hotword_rule` block supports:

* `hotword_regex` -
  (Required)
  Regular expression pattern defining what qualifies as a hotword.
  Structure is documented below.

* `proximity` -
  (Required)
  Proximity of the finding within which the entire hotword must reside. The total length of the window cannot
  exceed 1000 characters. Note that the finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords may be
  used to match substrings of the finding itself. For example, the certainty of a phone number regex
  `(\d{3}) \d{3}-\d{4}` could be adjusted upwards if the area code is known to be the local area code of a company
  office using the hotword regex `(xxx)`, where `xxx` is the area code in question.
  Structure is documented below.

  (Required)
  Likelihood adjustment to apply to all matching findings.
  Structure is documented below.


The `hotword_regex` block supports:

* `pattern` -
  (Required)
  Pattern defining the regular expression. Its syntax
  (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.

* `group_indexes` -

  The index of the submatch to extract as findings. When not specified,
  the entire match is returned. No more than 3 may be included.

The `proximity` block supports:

* `window_before` -
  (Optional)
  Number of characters before the finding to consider. Either this or window_after must be specified

* `window_after` -
  (Optional)
  Number of characters after the finding to consider. Either this or window_before must be specified

The `likelihood_adjustment` block supports:

* `fixed_likelihood` -
  (Optional)
  Set the likelihood of a finding to a fixed value. Either this or relative_likelihood can be set.
  Possible values are `VERY_UNLIKELY`, `UNLIKELY`, `POSSIBLE`, `LIKELY`, and `VERY_LIKELY`.

* `relative_likelihood` -
  (Optional)
  Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
  if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
  then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
  Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
  adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
  will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

The `exclusion_rule` block supports:

* `matching_type` -
