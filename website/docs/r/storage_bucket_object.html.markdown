 For more information see 
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/key-terms#objects) 
and 
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects).


## Example Usage

Example creating a public object in an existing `image-store` bucket.

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "picture" {
  name   = "butterfly01"
  source = "/images/nature/garden-tiger-moth.jpg"
  bucket = "image-store"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the containing bucket.

* `name` - (Required) The name of the object. If you're interpolating the name of this object, see `output_name` instead.

One of the following is required:

* `content` - (Optional, Sensitive) Data as `string` to be uploaded. Must be defined if `source` is not. **Note**: The `content` field is marked as sensitive. To view the raw contents of the object, please define an [output](/docs/configuration/outputs.html).

    if `content` is not.
