# google_vmwareengine_network_policy

Represents a network policy resource. Network policies are regional resources.


To get more information about NetworkPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.networkPolicies)

## Example Usage - Vmware Engine Network Policy Basic


```hcl
resource "google_vmwareengine_network" "network-policy-nw" {
    name              = "standard-nw"
    location          = "global" 
    type              = "STANDARD"
    description       = "VMwareEngine standard network sample"
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_network_policy" "vmw-engine-network-policy" {
    location = "us-west1"
    name = "sample-network-policy"
    edge_services_cidr = "192.168.30.0/26"
    vmware_engine_network = google_vmwareengine_network.network-policy-nw.id
}
```
## Example Usage - Vmware Engine Network Policy Full


```hcl
resource "google_vmwareengine_network" "network-policy-nw" {
    name              = "standard-full-nw"
    location          = "global" 
    type              = "STANDARD"
    description       = "VMwareEngine standard network sample"
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_network_policy" "vmw-engine-network-policy" {
    location = "us-west1"
    name = "sample-network-policy-full"
    edge_services_cidr = "192.168.30.0/26"
    vmware_engine_network = google_vmwareengine_network.network-policy-nw.id
    description = "Sample Network Policy"
    internet_access {
        enabled = true
    }
    external_ip {
        enabled = true
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `edge_services_cidr` -
  (Required)
  IP address range in CIDR notation used to create internet access and external IP access.
  An RFC 1918 CIDR block, with a "/26" prefix, is required. The range cannot overlap with any
  prefixes either in the consumer VPC network or in use by the private clouds attached to that VPC network.

* `vmware_engine_network` -
  (Required)
  The relative resource name of the VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form:
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmwareEngineNetworkId} where {project}
  can either be a project number or a project ID.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the location (region) to create the new network policy in.
  Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.
  For example: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the Network Policy.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  User-provided description for this network policy.

* `internet_access` -
  (Optional)
  Network service that allows VMware workloads to access the internet.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_internet_access).

* `external_ip` -
  (Optional)
  Network service that allows External IP addresses to be assigned to VMware workloads.
  This service can only be enabled when internetAccess is also enabled.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_external_ip).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_internet_access"></a>The `internet_access` block supports:

* `enabled` -
  (Optional)
  True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.

* `state` -
  (Output)
  State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.

<a name="nested_external_ip"></a>The `external_ip` block supports:

* `enabled` -
  (Optional)
  True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.

* `state` -
  (Output)
  State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Creation time of this resource.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and
  up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `update_time` -
  Last updated time of this resource.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine
  fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `uid` -
  System-generated unique identifier for the resource.

* `vmware_engine_network_canonical` -
  The canonical name of the VMware Engine network in the form:
  projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmwareEngineNetworkId}


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 60 minutes.

## Import


NetworkPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import NetworkPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}"
  to = google_vmwareengine_network_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), NetworkPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_vmwareengine_network_policy.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/networkPolicies/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_vmwareengine_network_policy.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_vmwareengine_network_policy.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
