# google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports
~> **Warning:** `google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_export` instead.

A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) Big Query Export Config.
It represents exporting Security Command Center data, including assets, findings, and security marks
using gcloud scc bqexports
~> **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.

## Example Usage - Scc V2 Organization Big Query Exports Config Basic


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "default" {
  dataset_id                  = "my-dataset"
  friendly_name               = "test"
  description                 = "This is a test description"
  location                    = "US"
  default_table_expiration_ms = 3600000
  default_partition_expiration_ms = null

  labels = {
    env = "default"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [default_partition_expiration_ms]
  }
}

resource "google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports" "custom_big_query_export_config" {
  name         = "my-export"
  big_query_export_id    = "my-export"
  organization = "123456789"
  dataset      = google_bigquery_dataset.default.id
  location     = "global"
  description  = "Cloud Security Command Center Findings Big Query Export Config"
  filter       = "state=\"ACTIVE\" AND NOT mute=\"MUTED\""
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `organization` -
  (Required)
  The organization whose Cloud Security Command Center the Big Query Export
  Config lives in.

* `big_query_export_id` -
  (Required)
  This must be unique within the organization.


* `name` -
  (Optional)
  The resource name of this export, in the format
  `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}`.
  This field is provided in responses, and is ignored when provided in create requests.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  The description of the notification config (max of 1024 characters).

* `dataset` -
  (Optional)
  The dataset to write findings' updates to.
  Its format is "projects/[projectId]/datasets/[bigquery_dataset_id]".
  BigQuery Dataset unique ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_).

* `filter` -
  (Optional)
  Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
  events of findings. The
  expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
  logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
  has higher precedence than AND.
  Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
  a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
  map to those defined in the corresponding resource.
  The supported operators are:
  * = for all value types.
  * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
  * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
  The supported value types are:
  * string literals in quotes.
  * integer literals without quotes.
  * boolean literals true and false without quotes.
  See
  [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications)
  for information on how to write a filter.

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  location Id is provided by organization. If not provided, Use global as default.

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}`

OrganizationSccBigQueryExports can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}`
* `{{organization}}/{{location}}/{{big_query_export_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import OrganizationSccBigQueryExports using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    organization = "<-required value->"
    bigQueryExportId = "<-required value->"
    location = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OrganizationSccBigQueryExports using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}"
  to = google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), OrganizationSccBigQueryExports can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports.default organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/bigQueryExports/{{big_query_export_id}}
$ terraform import google_scc_v2_organization_scc_big_query_exports.default {{organization}}/{{location}}/{{big_query_export_id}}
```
