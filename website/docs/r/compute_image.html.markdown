# google_compute_image

Represents an Image resource.

Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
running containers on Compute Engine.

Images can be either public or custom.

Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
to create an instance.


To get more information about Image, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/images)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images)

values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `image_encryption_key.raw_key`, `image_encryption_key.rsa_encrypted_key`, `source_disk_encryption_key.raw_key`, `source_disk_encryption_key.rsa_encrypted_key`, `source_image_encryption_key.raw_key`, `source_image_encryption_key.rsa_encrypted_key`, `source_snapshot_encryption_key.raw_key`, `source_snapshot_encryption_key.rsa_encrypted_key`.

```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Image can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_image.default projects/{{project}}/global/images/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_image.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_image.default {{name}}
