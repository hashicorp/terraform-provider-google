# google\_network\_security\_firewall\_endpoint\_association

Firewall endpoint association links a firewall endpoint to a VPC network in
the same zone. After you define this association, Cloud Firewall forwards the
zonal workload traffic in your VPC network that requires layer 7 inspection to
the attached firewall endpoint.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about FirewallEndpointAssociation, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.firewallEndpointAssociations#FirewallEndpointAssociation)
* How-to Guides
    * [Firewall endpoint overview](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/about-firewall-endpoints)

  provider    = google-beta
  name        = "my-firewall-endpoint"
  parent      = "organizations/123456789"
  location    = "us-central1-a"

  labels = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}

resource "google_network_security_firewall_endpoint_association" "default_association" {
  provider    = google-beta
  name        = "my-firewall-endpoint-association"
  parent      = "projects/my-project-name"
  location    = "us-central1-a"

  labels = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/firewallEndpointAssociations/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_security_firewall_endpoint_association.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), FirewallEndpointAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_security_firewall_endpoint_association.default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/firewallEndpointAssociations/{{name}}
```
