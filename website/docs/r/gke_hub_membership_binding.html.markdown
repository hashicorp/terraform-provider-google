MembershipBinding is a subresource of a Membership, representing what Fleet Scopes (or other, future Fleet resources) a Membership is bound to.

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/fleet-management/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.memberships.bindings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Registering a Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster#register_cluster)

## Example Usage - Gkehub Membership Binding Basic


```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name               = "basiccluster"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 1
  deletion_protection  = "true"
}

resource "google_gke_hub_membership" "membership" {
  membership_id = "tf-test-membership%{random_suffix}"
  endpoint {
    gke_cluster {
      resource_link = "//container.googleapis.com/${google_container_cluster.primary.id}"
    }
  }
  
  depends_on = [google_container_cluster.primary]
}

resource "google_gke_hub_scope" "scope" {
  scope_id = "tf-test-scope%{random_suffix}"
}

resource "google_gke_hub_membership_binding" "membership_binding" {
  membership_binding_id = "tf-test-membership-binding%{random_suffix}"
  scope = google_gke_hub_scope.scope.name
  membership_id = google_gke_hub_membership.membership.membership_id
  location = "global"
  labels = {
      keyb = "valueb"
      keya = "valuea"
      keyc = "valuec" 
  }
  depends_on = [
    google_gke_hub_membership.membership,
    google_gke_hub_scope.scope
  ]
}
```

## Import


MembershipBinding can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/bindings/{{membership_binding_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_binding_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_binding_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MembershipBinding using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/bindings/{{membership_binding_id}}"
  to = google_gke_hub_membership_binding.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), MembershipBinding can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_gke_hub_membership_binding.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/bindings/{{membership_binding_id}}
$ terraform import google_gke_hub_membership_binding.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_binding_id}}
$ terraform import google_gke_hub_membership_binding.default {{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_binding_id}}
```
