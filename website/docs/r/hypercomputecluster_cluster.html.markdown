# google_hypercomputecluster_cluster

A collection of virtual machines and connected resources forming a high-performance computing cluster capable of running large-scale, tightly coupled workloads. A cluster combines a set a compute resources that perform computations, storage resources that contain inputs and store outputs, an orchestrator that is responsible for assigning jobs to compute resources, and network resources that connect everything together.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster_id}}`

* `create_time` -
  Time that the cluster was originally created.

* `name` -
  Identifier. [Relative resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122) of the cluster, in the
  format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}`.

* `reconciling` -
  Indicates whether changes to the cluster are currently in flight. If this
  is `true`, then the current state might not match the cluster's intended
  state.

* `update_time` -
  Time that the cluster was most recently updated.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


Cluster can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{cluster_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{cluster_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Cluster using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster_id}}"
  to = google_hypercomputecluster_cluster.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Cluster can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_hypercomputecluster_cluster.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster_id}}
$ terraform import google_hypercomputecluster_cluster.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{cluster_id}}
$ terraform import google_hypercomputecluster_cluster.default {{location}}/{{cluster_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
