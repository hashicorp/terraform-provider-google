# google_compute_interconnect_attachment_group

An interconnect attachment group resource allows customers to create,
analyze, and expand highly available deployments.


To get more information about InterconnectAttachmentGroup, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnects)
* How-to Guides

## Example Usage - Interconnect Attachment Group Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_interconnect_attachment_group" "example-interconnect-attachment-group" {
  name   = "example-interconnect-attachment-group"
  intent {
    availability_sla = "NO_SLA"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be
  1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
  long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
  character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
  lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `intent` -
  (Required)
  The user's intent for this group. This is the only required field besides
  the name that must be specified on group creation.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_intent).


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `attachments` -
  (Optional)
  Attachments in the AttachmentGroup. Keys are arbitrary user-specified
  strings. Users are encouraged, but not required, to use their preferred
  format for resource links as keys.
  Note that there are add-members and remove-members methods in gcloud.
  The size of this map is limited by an "Attachments per group" quota.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_attachments).

* `interconnect_group` -
  (Optional)
  The URL of an InterconnectGroup that groups these Attachments'
  Interconnects. Customers do not need to set this unless directed by
  Google Support.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_intent"></a>The `intent` block supports:

* `availability_sla` -
  (Optional)
  Which SLA the user intends this group to support.
  Possible values are: `PRODUCTION_NON_CRITICAL`, `PRODUCTION_CRITICAL`, `NO_SLA`, `AVAILABILITY_SLA_UNSPECIFIED`.

<a name="nested_attachments"></a>The `attachments` block supports:

* `name` - (Required) The identifier for this object. Format specified above.

* `attachment` -
  (Optional)

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectAttachmentGroups/{{name}}`

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `logical_structure` -
  An analysis of the logical layout of Attachments in this
  group. Every Attachment in the group is shown once in this structure.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_logical_structure).

* `configured` -
  The redundancy this group is configured to support. The way a
  user queries what SLA their Attachment gets is by looking at this field of
  the Attachment's AttachmentGroup.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_configured).


<a name="nested_logical_structure"></a>The `logical_structure` block contains:

* `regions` -
  (Output)
  The regions Attachments in this group are in.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_logical_structure_regions).


<a name="nested_logical_structure_regions"></a>The `regions` block contains:

* `region` -
  (Output)
  The name of a region, like "us-central1".

* `metros` -
  (Output)
  The metros of Attachments in this group in this region.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros).


<a name="nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros"></a>The `metros` block contains:

* `metro` -
  (Output)
  The name of the metro, as a three-letter lowercase
  string like "iad". This is the first component of the location of an
  Interconnect.

* `facilities` -
  (Output)
  The facilities used for this group's Attachments'
  Interconnects.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros_metros_facilities).


<a name="nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros_metros_facilities"></a>The `facilities` block contains:

* `facility` -
  (Output)
  The name of a facility, like "iad-1234".

* `zones` -
  (Output)
  The zones that Interconnects in this facility are
  present in.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros_metros_facilities_facilities_zones).


<a name="nested_logical_structure_regions_regions_metros_metros_facilities_facilities_zones"></a>The `zones` block contains:

* `zone` -
  (Output)
  The zones that Attachments in this group are present
  in, in the given facilities.  This is inherited from their
  Interconnects.

* `attachment` -
  (Output)
  URLs of Attachments in the given zone, to the given
  region, on Interconnects in the given facility and metro. Every
  Attachment in the AG has such an entry.

<a name="nested_configured"></a>The `configured` block contains:

* `availability_sla` -
  (Output)
  Which SLA this group is configured to support, and why this
  group does or does not meet that SLA's requirements.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_configured_availability_sla).


<a name="nested_configured_availability_sla"></a>The `availability_sla` block contains:

* `effective_sla` -
  (Output)
  Which SLA this group supports. Options are the same as the
  intent.

* `intended_sla_blockers` -
  (Output)
  Reasons why configuration.availabilitySLA.sla differs from
  intent.availabilitySLA. This list is empty if and only if those are the
  same.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_configured_availability_sla_intended_sla_blockers).


<a name="nested_configured_availability_sla_intended_sla_blockers"></a>The `intended_sla_blockers` block contains:

* `blocker_type` -
  (Output)
  The category of an unmet SLA requirement.

* `explanation` -
  (Output)
  A human-readable explanation of this requirement and
  why it's not met. This is set for every type of requirement.

* `documentation_link` -
  (Output)
  The url of Google Cloud public documentation explaining
  this requirement. This is set for every type of requirement.

## Import


InterconnectAttachmentGroup can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectAttachmentGroups/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import InterconnectAttachmentGroup using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/global/interconnectAttachmentGroups/{{name}}"
  to = google_compute_interconnect_attachment_group.default
}
```
