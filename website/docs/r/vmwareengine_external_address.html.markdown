# google\_vmwareengine\_external\_address

An allocated external IP address and its corresponding internal IP address in a private cloud.


To get more information about ExternalAddress, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.privateClouds.externalAddresses)

## Example Usage - Vmware Engine External Address Basic


```hcl
resource "google_vmwareengine_network" "external-address-nw" {
  name        = "pc-nw"
  location    = "global"
  type        = "STANDARD"
  description = "PC network description."
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_private_cloud" "external-address-pc" {
  location    = "-a"
  name        = "sample-pc"
  description = "Sample test PC."
  network_config {
    management_cidr       = "192.168.50.0/24"
    vmware_engine_network = google_vmwareengine_network.external-address-nw.id
  }

  management_cluster {
    cluster_id = "sample-mgmt-cluster"
    node_type_configs {
      node_type_id = "standard-72"
      node_count   = 3
    }
  }
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_network_policy" "external-address-np" {
  location = ""
  name = "sample-np"
  edge_services_cidr = "192.168.30.0/26"
  vmware_engine_network = google_vmwareengine_network.external-address-nw.id
}

resource "google_vmwareengine_external_address" "vmw-engine-external-address" {
  name = "sample-external-address"
  parent = google_vmwareengine_private_cloud.external-address-pc.id
  internal_ip = "192.168.0.66"
  description = "Sample description."
  depends_on = [
    google_vmwareengine_network_policy.external-address-np,
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `internal_ip` -
  (Required)
  The internal IP address of a workload VM.

* `parent` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the private cloud to create a new external address in.
  Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


ExternalAddress can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/externalAddresses/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import ExternalAddress using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/externalAddresses/{{name}}"
  to = google_vmwareengine_external_address.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), ExternalAddress can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_vmwareengine_external_address.default {{parent}}/externalAddresses/{{name}}
```
