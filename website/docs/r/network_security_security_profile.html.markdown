A security profile defines the behavior associated to a profile type.

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.securityProfiles)
* How-to Guides
    * [Create and manage security profiles](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/configure-security-profiles)

## Example Usage - Network Security Security Profile Basic


```hcl
resource "google_network_security_security_profile" "default" {
  provider    = google-beta
  name        = "my-security-profile"
  parent      = "organizations/123456789"
  description = "my description"
  type        = "THREAT_PREVENTION"

  labels = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Network Security Security Profile Overrides


```hcl
resource "google_network_security_security_profile" "default" {
  provider    = google-beta
  name        = "my-security-profile"
  parent      = "organizations/123456789"
  description = "my description"
  type        = "THREAT_PREVENTION"

  threat_prevention_profile {
    severity_overrides {
      action   = "ALLOW"
      severity = "INFORMATIONAL"
    }

    severity_overrides {
      action   = "DENY"
      severity = "HIGH"
    }

    threat_overrides {
      action    = "ALLOW"
      threat_id = "280647"
    }
  }
}
```

* `create_time` -
  Time the security profile was created in UTC.

* `update_time` -
  Time the security profile was updated in UTC.

## Import


SecurityProfile can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/securityProfiles/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SecurityProfile using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/securityProfiles/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_security_security_profile.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SecurityProfile can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_security_security_profile.default {{parent}}/locations/{{location}}/securityProfiles/{{name}}
```
