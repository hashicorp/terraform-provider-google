# google\_storage\_object\_access\_control

The ObjectAccessControls resources represent the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) for objects within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify
who has access to your data and to what extent.

There are two roles that can be assigned to an entity:

READERs can get an object, though the acl property will not be revealed.
OWNERs are READERs, and they can get the acl property, update an object,
and call all objectAccessControls methods on the object. The owner of an
object is always an OWNER.
For more information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API
uses READER and OWNER instead of READ and FULL_CONTROL.


To get more information about ObjectAccessControl, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objectAccessControls)
* How-to Guides

  role   = "READER"
  entity = "allUsers"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "bucket" {
	name = "static-content-bucket"
}

 resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "object" {
