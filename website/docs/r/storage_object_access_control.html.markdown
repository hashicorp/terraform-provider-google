# google_storage_object_access_control

The ObjectAccessControls resources represent the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) for objects within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify
who has access to your data and to what extent.

There are two roles that can be assigned to an entity:

READERs can get an object, though the acl property will not be revealed.
OWNERs are READERs, and they can get the acl property, update an object,
and call all objectAccessControls methods on the object. The owner of an
object is always an OWNER.
For more information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API
uses READER and OWNER instead of READ and FULL_CONTROL.


To get more information about ObjectAccessControl, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objectAccessControls)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/create-manage-lists)

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


ObjectAccessControl can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{bucket}}/{{object}}/{{entity}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import ObjectAccessControl using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{bucket}}/{{object}}/{{entity}}"
  to = google_storage_object_access_control.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), ObjectAccessControl can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_storage_object_access_control.default {{bucket}}/{{object}}/{{entity}}
```
