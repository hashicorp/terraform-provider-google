with a GKE cluster.

-> See the [Using GKE with Terraform](/docs/providers/google/guides/using_gke_with_terraform.html)
guide for more information about using GKE with Terraform.

Manages a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/clusters)
and [the API reference](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.clusters).

~> **Warning:** All arguments and attributes, including basic auth username and
passwords as well as certificate outputs will be stored in the raw state as
plaintext. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - with a separately managed node pool (recommended)

```hcl
resource "google_service_account" "default" {
  account_id   = "service-account-id"
  display_name = "Service Account"
}

resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = "my-gke-cluster"
  location = "us-central1"

  # We can't create a cluster with no node pool defined, but we want to only use
  # separately managed node pools. So we create the smallest possible default
  # node pool and immediately delete it.
  remove_default_node_pool = true
  initial_node_count       = 1
}

resource "google_container_node_pool" "primary_preemptible_nodes" {
  name       = "my-node-pool"
  location   = "us-central1"
  cluster    = google_container_cluster.primary.name
  node_count = 1

  node_config {
    preemptible  = true
    machine_type = "e2-medium"

    # Google recommends custom service accounts that have cloud-platform scope and permissions granted via IAM Roles.
    service_account = google_service_account.default.email
    oauth_scopes    = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
    ]
  }
}
```

~> **Note:** It is recommended that node pools be created and managed as separate resources as in the example above.
This allows node pools to be added and removed without recreating the cluster.  Node pools defined directly in the
`google_container_cluster` resource cannot be removed without re-creating the cluster.

## Example Usage - with the default node pool

```hcl
resource "google_service_account" "default" {
  account_id   = "service-account-id"
  display_name = "Service Account"
}

resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name               = "marcellus-wallace"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 3
  node_config {
    # Google recommends custom service accounts that have cloud-platform scope and permissions granted via IAM Roles.
    service_account = google_service_account.default.email
    oauth_scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
    ]
    labels = {
      foo = "bar"
    }
    tags = ["foo", "bar"]
  }
  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "40m"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the cluster, unique within the project and
location.

- - -

* `location` - (Optional) The location (region or zone) in which the cluster
master will be created, as well as the default node location. If you specify a
zone (such as `us-central1-a`), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a
single cluster master. If you specify a region (such as `us-west1`), the
cluster will be a regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in
the region, and with default node locations in those zones as well

* `node_locations` - (Optional) The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.

-> A "multi-zonal" cluster is a zonal cluster with at least one additional zone
defined; in a multi-zonal cluster, the cluster master is only present in a
single zone while nodes are present in each of the primary zone and the node
locations. In contrast, in a regional cluster, cluster master nodes are present
in multiple zones in the region. For that reason, regional clusters should be
preferred.

* `addons_config` - (Optional) The configuration for addons supported by GKE.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_addons_config).

* `allow_net_admin` - (Optional) Enable NET_ADMIN for the cluster. Defaults to 
`false`. This field should only be enabled for Autopilot clusters (`enable_autopilot`
set to `true`).

* `cluster_ipv4_cidr` - (Optional) The IP address range of the Kubernetes pods
in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g. `10.96.0.0/14`). Leave blank to have one
automatically chosen or specify a `/14` block in `10.0.0.0/8`. This field will
only work for routes-based clusters, where `ip_allocation_policy` is not defined.

* `cluster_autoscaling` - (Optional)
Per-cluster configuration of Node Auto-Provisioning with Cluster Autoscaler to
automatically adjust the size of the cluster and create/delete node pools based
on the current needs of the cluster's workload. See the
[guide to using Node Auto-Provisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning)
for more details. Structure is [documented below](#nested_cluster_autoscaling).

* `binary_authorization` - (Optional) Configuration options for the Binary
  Authorization feature. Structure is [documented below](#nested_binary_authorization).

* `service_external_ips_config` - (Optional)
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_service_external_ips_config).

* `mesh_certificates` - (Optional)
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_mesh_encryption).

* `database_encryption` - (Optional)
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_database_encryption).

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the cluster.

* `default_max_pods_per_node` - (Optional) The default maximum number of pods
per node in this cluster. This doesn't work on "routes-based" clusters, clusters
that don't have IP Aliasing enabled. See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr)
for more information.

* `enable_binary_authorization` - (DEPRECATED) Enable Binary Authorization for this cluster.
    If enabled, all container images will be validated by Google Binary Authorization.
    Deprecated in favor of `binary_authorization`.

* `enable_kubernetes_alpha` - (Optional) Whether to enable Kubernetes Alpha features for
    this cluster. Note that when this option is enabled, the cluster cannot be upgraded
    and will be automatically deleted after 30 days.

* `enable_k8s_beta_apis` - (Optional) Configuration for Kubernetes Beta APIs.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_enable_k8s_beta_apis).

* `enable_tpu` - (Optional) Whether to enable Cloud TPU resources in this cluster.
    See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup).

* `enable_legacy_abac` - (Optional) Whether the ABAC authorizer is enabled for this cluster.
    When enabled, identities in the system, including service accounts, nodes, and controllers,
    will have statically granted permissions beyond those provided by the RBAC configuration or IAM.
    Defaults to `false`

* `enable_shielded_nodes` - (Optional) Enable Shielded Nodes features on all nodes in this cluster.  Defaults to `true`.

* `enable_autopilot` - (Optional) Enable Autopilot for this cluster. Defaults to `false`.
    Note that when this option is enabled, certain features of Standard GKE are not available.
    See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview#comparison)
    for available features.

* `initial_node_count` - (Optional) The number of nodes to create in this
cluster's default node pool. In regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the
number of nodes per zone. Must be set if `node_pool` is not set. If you're using
`google_container_node_pool` objects with no default node pool, you'll need to
set this to a value of at least `1`, alongside setting
`remove_default_node_pool` to `true`.

* `ip_allocation_policy` - (Optional) Configuration of cluster IP allocation for
VPC-native clusters. Adding this block enables [IP aliasing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases),
making the cluster VPC-native instead of routes-based. Structure is [documented
below](#nested_ip_allocation_policy).

* `networking_mode` - (Optional) Determines whether alias IPs or routes will be used for pod IPs in the cluster.
Options are `VPC_NATIVE` or `ROUTES`. `VPC_NATIVE` enables [IP aliasing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-aliases),
and requires the `ip_allocation_policy` block to be defined. By default, when this field is unspecified and no `ip_allocation_policy` blocks are set, GKE will create a `ROUTES`-based cluster.

* `logging_config` - (Optional) Logging configuration for the cluster.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_logging_config).

* `logging_service` - (Optional) The logging service that the cluster should
    write logs to. Available options include `logging.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver),
    `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Logging), and `none`. Defaults to `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`

* `maintenance_policy` - (Optional) The maintenance policy to use for the cluster. Structure is
    [documented below](#nested_maintenance_policy).

* `master_auth` - (Optional) The authentication information for accessing the
Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
you see an unexpected diff unsetting your client cert, ensure you have the
`container.clusters.getCredentials` permission.
Structure is [documented below](#nested_master_auth).

* `master_authorized_networks_config` - (Optional) The desired
    configuration options for master authorized networks. Omit the
    nested `cidr_blocks` attribute to disallow external access (except
    the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_master_authorized_networks_config).

* `min_master_version` - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE
    will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
    current master version--use the read-only `master_version` field to obtain that.
    If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
    official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
    the `google_container_engine_versions` data source useful - it indicates which versions
    are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
    Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
    [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#specifying_cluster_version)
    describe the various acceptable formats for this field.

-> If you are using the `google_container_engine_versions` datasource with a regional cluster, ensure that you have provided a `location`
to the datasource. A region can have a different set of supported versions than its corresponding zones, and not all zones in a
region are guaranteed to support the same version.

* `monitoring_config` - (Optional) Monitoring configuration for the cluster.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_monitoring_config).

* `monitoring_service` - (Optional) The monitoring service that the cluster
    should write metrics to.
    Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
    VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
    Available options include
    `monitoring.googleapis.com`(Legacy Stackdriver), `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and `none`.
    Defaults to `monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes`

* `network` - (Optional) The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
    network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the
    shared network.

* `network_policy` - (Optional) Configuration options for the
    [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/networkpolicies/)
    feature. Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_policy).

* `node_config` -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
    Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
    `google_container_node_pool` or a `node_pool` block; this configuration
    manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with
    Terraform. Structure is [documented below](#nested_node_config).

* `node_pool` - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
    See [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) for schema.
    **Warning:** node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
    cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
    to say "these are the _only_ node pools associated with this cluster", use the
    [google_container_node_pool](container_node_pool.html) resource instead of this property.

* `node_pool_auto_config` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Node pool configs that apply to auto-provisioned node pools in
    [autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview#comparison) clusters and
    [node auto-provisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning)-enabled clusters. Structure is [documented below](#nested_node_pool_auto_config).

* `node_pool_defaults` - (Optional) Default NodePool settings for the entire cluster. These settings are overridden if specified on the specific NodePool object. Structure is [documented below](#nested_node_pool_defaults).

* `node_version` - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
    or set to the same value as `min_master_version` on create. Defaults to the default
    version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
    nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
    recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
    when fuzzy versions are used. See the `google_container_engine_versions` data source's
    `version_prefix` field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
    To update nodes in other node pools, use the `version` attribute on the node pool.

* `notification_config` - (Optional) Configuration for the [cluster upgrade notifications](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-upgrade-notifications) feature. Structure is [documented below](#nested_notification_config).

* `confidential_nodes` - Configuration for [Confidential Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/confidential-gke-nodes) feature. Structure is documented below [documented below](#nested_confidential_nodes).

   [ClusterTelemetry](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/kubernetes-engine/installing#controlling_the_collection_of_application_logs) feature,
   Structure is [documented below](#nested_cluster_telemetry).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `release_channel` - (Optional)
Configuration options for the [Release channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels)
feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
[Selecting a new release channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/release-channels#selecting_a_new_release_channel)
for more details; the `google_container_engine_versions` datasource can provide
the default version for a channel. Note that removing the `release_channel`
field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the `"UNSPECIFIED"`
channel. Structure is [documented below](#nested_release_channel).

* `remove_default_node_pool` - (Optional) If `true`, deletes the default node
    pool upon cluster creation. If you're using `google_container_node_pool`
    resources with no default node pool, this should be set to `true`, alongside
    setting `initial_node_count` to at least `1`.

* `resource_labels` - (Optional) The GCE resource labels (a map of key/value pairs) to be applied to the cluster.

* `cost_management_config` - (Optional) Configuration for the
    [Cost Allocation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cost-allocations) feature.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 40 minutes.
- `read`   - Default is 40 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 40 minutes.

## Import

GKE clusters can be imported using the `project` , `location`, and `name`. If the project is omitted, the default
provider value will be used. Examples:

```
$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster projects/my-gcp-project/locations/us-east1-a/clusters/my-cluster

$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster my-gcp-project/us-east1-a/my-cluster

$ terraform import google_container_cluster.mycluster us-east1-a/my-cluster
```

~> **Note:** This resource has several fields that control Terraform-specific behavior and aren't present in the API. If they are set in config and you import a cluster, Terraform may need to perform an update immediately after import. Most of these updates should be no-ops but some may modify your cluster if the imported state differs.

For example, the following fields will show diffs if set in config:

- `min_master_version`
- `remove_default_node_pool`
