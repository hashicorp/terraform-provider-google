# google_apigee_developer_app

Creates an app associated with a developer.
This API associates the developer app with the specified API product
and auto-generates an API key for the app to use in calls to API proxies
inside that API product.


To get more information about DeveloperApp, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.developers.apps)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a developer](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `credentials.consumer_secret`.

* `api_products` -
  (Optional)
  List of API products associated with the developer app.

## Import


DeveloperApp can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{org_id}}/developers/{{developer_email}}/apps/{{name}}`
* `{{org_id}}/{{developer_email}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DeveloperApp using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{org_id}}/developers/{{developer_email}}/apps/{{name}}"
  to = google_apigee_developer_app.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), DeveloperApp can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apigee_developer_app.default {{org_id}}/developers/{{developer_email}}/apps/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_apigee_developer_app.default {{org_id}}/{{developer_email}}/{{name}}
```
