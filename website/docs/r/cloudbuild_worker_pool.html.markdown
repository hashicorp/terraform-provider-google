  Configuration for custom WorkerPool to run builds
---

# google\_cloudbuild\_worker\_pool

Definition of custom Cloud Build WorkerPools for running jobs with custom configuration and custom networking.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_cloudbuild_worker_pool" "pool" {
  name = "my-pool"
  location = "europe-west1"
  worker_config {
    disk_size_gb = 100
    machine_type = "e2-standard-4"
    no_external_ip = false
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Network Config

```hcl
resource "google_project_service" "servicenetworking" {
  service = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  disable_on_destroy = false
}

resource "google_compute_network" "network" {
  name                    = "my-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
  depends_on = [google_project_service.servicenetworking]
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "worker_range" {
  name          = "worker-pool-range"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.network.id
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "worker_pool_conn" {
  network                 = google_compute_network.network.id
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.worker_range.name]
  depends_on              = [google_project_service.servicenetworking]
}

resource "google_cloudbuild_worker_pool" "pool" {
  name = "my-pool"
  location = "europe-west1"
  worker_config {
    disk_size_gb = 100
    machine_type = "e2-standard-4"
    no_external_ip = false
  }
  network_config {
    peered_network = google_compute_network.network.id
    peered_network_ip_range = "/29"
  }
  depends_on = [google_service_networking_connection.worker_pool_conn]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource
  
* `name` -
  (Required)
  User-defined name of the `WorkerPool`.
  

- - -

* `network_config` -
  (Optional)
  Network configuration for the `WorkerPool`. Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_config).
  
* `project` -
  (Optional)
  The project for the resource
  
* `worker_config` -
  (Optional)
  Configuration to be used for a creating workers in the `WorkerPool`. Structure is [documented below](#nested_worker_config).
  


<a name="nested_network_config"></a>The `network_config` block supports:
    
* `peered_network` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The network definition that the workers are peered to. If this section is left empty, the workers will be peered to `WorkerPool.project_id` on the service producer network. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where `{project}` is a project number, such as `12345`, and `{network}` is the name of a VPC network in the project. See (https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/set-up-custom-worker-pool-environment#understanding_the_network_configuration_options)

* `peered_network_ip_range` -
  (Optional)
  Immutable. Subnet IP range within the peered network. This is specified in CIDR notation with a slash and the subnet prefix size. You can optionally specify an IP address before the subnet prefix value. e.g. `192.168.0.0/29` would specify an IP range starting at 192.168.0.0 with a prefix size of 29 bits. `/16` would specify a prefix size of 16 bits, with an automatically determined IP within the peered VPC. If unspecified, a value of `/24` will be used.
    
<a name="nested_worker_config"></a>The `worker_config` block supports:
    
* `disk_size_gb` -
  (Optional)
  Size of the disk attached to the worker, in GB. See (https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file). Specify a value of up to 1000. If `0` is specified, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
    
* `machine_type` -
  (Optional)
  Machine type of a worker, such as `n1-standard-1`. See (https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file). If left blank, Cloud Build will use `n1-standard-1`.
    
* `no_external_ip` -
  (Optional)
  If true, workers are created without any public address, which prevents network egress to public IPs.
    
## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workerPools/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the request to create the `WorkerPool` was received.
  
* `delete_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the request to delete the `WorkerPool` was received.
  
* `state` -
  Output only. WorkerPool state. Possible values: STATE_UNSPECIFIED, PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED
  
* `update_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the request to update the `WorkerPool` was received.
  
## Timeouts
