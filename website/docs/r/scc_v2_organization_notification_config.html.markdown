# google_scc_v2_organization_notification_config

A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) notification configs. A
notification config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
configuration to send notifications for create/update events of
findings, assets and etc.
~> **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled
in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.


To get more information about OrganizationNotificationConfig, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/v2/organizations.locations.notificationConfigs)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs)

## Example Usage - Scc V2 Organization Notification Config Basic


```hcl
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "scc_v2_organization_notification_config" {
  name = "my-topic"
}

resource "google_scc_v2_organization_notification_config" "custom_organization_notification_config" {
  config_id    = "my-config"
  organization = "123456789"
  location     = "global"
  description  = "My custom Cloud Security Command Center Finding Organization Notification Configuration"
  pubsub_topic = google_pubsub_topic.scc_v2_organization_notification_config.id

  streaming_config {
    filter = "category = \"OPEN_FIREWALL\" AND state = \"ACTIVE\""
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `pubsub_topic` -
  (Required)
  The Pub/Sub topic to send notifications to. Its format is
  "projects/[project_id]/topics/[topic]".

* `streaming_config` -
  (Required)
  The config for triggering streaming-based notifications.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_streaming_config).

* `organization` -
  (Required)
  The organization whose Cloud Security Command Center the Notification
  Config lives in.

* `config_id` -
  (Required)
  This must be unique within the organization.


<a name="nested_streaming_config"></a>The `streaming_config` block supports:

* `filter` -
  (Required)
  Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
  events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The
  expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
  logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
  has higher precedence than AND.
  Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
  a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
  map to those defined in the corresponding resource.
  The supported operators are:
  * = for all value types.
  * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
  * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.
  The supported value types are:
  * string literals in quotes.
  * integer literals without quotes.
  * boolean literals true and false without quotes.
