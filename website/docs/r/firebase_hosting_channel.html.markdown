# google_firebase_hosting_channel

A `Channel` represents a stream of releases for a site. All sites have a default
`live` channel that serves content to the Firebase-provided subdomains and any
connected custom domains.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Channel, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/sites.channels)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Basic


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_hosting_site" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id = "site-with-channel"
}

resource "google_firebase_hosting_channel" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  site_id = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  channel_id = "channel-basic"
}
```
## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Full


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_hosting_site" "default" {
  provider = google-beta
  project  = "my-project-name"
  site_id = "site-with-channel"
}

resource "google_firebase_hosting_channel" "full" {
  provider = google-beta
  site_id = google_firebase_hosting_site.default.site_id
  channel_id = "channel-full"
  ttl = "86400s"
  retained_release_count = 20
  labels = {
    "some-key": "some-value"
  }
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Channel using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "sites/{{site_id}}/channels/{{channel_id}}"
  to = google_firebase_hosting_channel.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Channel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_hosting_channel.default sites/{{site_id}}/channels/{{channel_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_hosting_channel.default {{site_id}}/{{channel_id}}
```
