# google_privateca_certificate_template

Certificate Authority Service provides reusable and parameterized templates that you can use for common certificate issuance scenarios. A certificate template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate issuance schema within an organization. A certificate template can essentially become a full-fledged vertical certificate issuance framework.


To get more information about CertificateTemplate, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/reference/rest)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name for this CertificateTemplate in the format `projects/*/locations/*/certificateTemplates/*`.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource


- - -


* `predefined_values` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A set of X.509 values that will be applied to all issued certificates that use this template. If the certificate request includes conflicting values for the same properties, they will be overwritten by the values defined here. If the issuing CaPool's IssuancePolicy defines conflicting baseline_values for the same properties, the certificate issuance request will fail.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_predefined_values).

* `identity_constraints` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Describes constraints on identities that may be appear in Certificates issued using this template. If this is omitted, then this template will not add restrictions on a certificate's identity.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_identity_constraints).

* `passthrough_extensions` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Describes the set of X.509 extensions that may appear in a Certificate issued using this CertificateTemplate. If a certificate request sets extensions that don't appear in the passthrough_extensions, those extensions will be dropped. If the issuing CaPool's IssuancePolicy defines baseline_values that don't appear here, the certificate issuance request will fail. If this is omitted, then this template will not add restrictions on a certificate's X.509 extensions. These constraints do not apply to X.509 extensions set in this CertificateTemplate's predefined_values.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_passthrough_extensions).

* `maximum_lifetime` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The maximum lifetime allowed for all issued certificates that use this template. If the issuing CaPool's IssuancePolicy specifies a maximum lifetime the minimum of the two durations will be the maximum lifetime for issued. Note that if the issuing CertificateAuthority expires before a Certificate's requested maximum_lifetime, the effective lifetime will be explicitly truncated to match it.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A human-readable description of scenarios this template is intended for.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Labels with user-defined metadata.
