# google_privateca_certificate_template

Certificate Authority Service provides reusable and parameterized templates that you can use for common certificate issuance scenarios. A certificate template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate issuance schema within an organization.  A certificate template can essentially become a full-fledged vertical certificate issuance framework.

For more information, see:
* [Understanding Certificate Templates](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/certificate-template)
* [Common configurations and Certificate Profiles](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/certificate-profile)
## Example Usage - basic_certificate_template
An example of a basic privateca certificate template
```hcl
resource "google_privateca_certificate_template" "primary" {
  location    = "us-west1"
  name        = "template"
  description = "An updated sample certificate template"

  identity_constraints {
    allow_subject_alt_names_passthrough = true
    allow_subject_passthrough           = true

    cel_expression {
      description = "Always true"
      expression  = "true"
      location    = "any.file.anywhere"
      title       = "Sample expression"
    }
  }

  labels = {
    label-two = "value-two"
  }

  passthrough_extensions {
    additional_extensions {
      object_id_path = [1, 6]
    }

    known_extensions = ["EXTENDED_KEY_USAGE"]
  }

  predefined_values {
    additional_extensions {
      object_id {
        object_id_path = [1, 6]
      }

      value    = "c3RyaW5nCg=="

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource
  
* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name for this CertificateTemplate in the format `projects/*/locations/*/certificateTemplates/*`.
  


The `object_id` block supports:
    
* `object_id_path` -
  (Required)
  Required. The parts of an OID path. The most significant parts of the path come first.
    
- - -

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A human-readable description of scenarios this template is intended for.
  
* `identity_constraints` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Describes constraints on identities that may be appear in Certificates issued using this template. If this is omitted, then this template will not add restrictions on a certificate's identity.
  
* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Labels with user-defined metadata.
  
* `passthrough_extensions` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Describes the set of X.509 extensions that may appear in a Certificate issued using this CertificateTemplate. If a certificate request sets extensions that don't appear in the passthrough_extensions, those extensions will be dropped. If the issuing CaPool's IssuancePolicy defines baseline_values that don't appear here, the certificate issuance request will fail. If this is omitted, then this template will not add restrictions on a certificate's X.509 extensions. These constraints do not apply to X.509 extensions set in this CertificateTemplate's predefined_values.
  
* `predefined_values` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A set of X.509 values that will be applied to all issued certificates that use this template. If the certificate request includes conflicting values for the same properties, they will be overwritten by the values defined here. If the issuing CaPool's IssuancePolicy defines conflicting baseline_values for the same properties, the certificate issuance request will fail.
  
* `project` -
  (Optional)
  The project for the resource
  


The `identity_constraints` block supports:

* `allow_subject_passthrough` -
  (Required)
  Required. If this is true, the Subject field may be copied from a certificate request into the signed certificate. Otherwise, the requested Subject will be discarded.
    
* `cel_expression` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. A CEL expression that may be used to validate the resolved X.509 Subject and/or Subject Alternative Name before a certificate is signed. To see the full allowed syntax and some examples, see https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/using-cel
