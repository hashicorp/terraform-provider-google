# google\_cloud\_run\_v2\_service

Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of configurations and revision templates which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership.


To get more information about Service, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.services)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/)

  Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter, or break down billing charges by team, component, environment, state, etc.
  For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels or https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected.
  All system labels in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 RevisionTemplate.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected.
  All system annotations in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 RevisionTemplate.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/services/{{name}}`

* `uid` -
  Server assigned unique identifier for the trigger. The value is a UUID4 string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until the resource is deleted.

* `generation` -
  A number that monotonically increases every time the user modifies the desired state. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a string instead of an integer.

* `create_time` -
  The creation time.

* `update_time` -
  The last-modified time.

* `delete_time` -
  The deletion time.

* `expire_time` -
  For a deleted resource, the time after which it will be permamently deleted.

* `creator` -
  Email address of the authenticated creator.

* `last_modifier` -
  Email address of the last authenticated modifier.

* `observed_generation` -
  The generation of this Service currently serving traffic. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a string instead of an integer.

* `terminal_condition` -
  The Condition of this Service, containing its readiness status, and detailed error information in case it did not reach a serving state. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_terminal_condition).

* `conditions` -
  The Conditions of all other associated sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics information in case the Service does not reach its Serving state. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conditions).

* `latest_ready_revision` -
  Name of the latest revision that is serving traffic. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.

* `latest_created_revision` -
  Name of the last created revision. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.

* `traffic_statuses` -
  Detailed status information for corresponding traffic targets. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_traffic_statuses).

* `uri` -
  The main URI in which this Service is serving traffic.

* `reconciling` -
  Returns true if the Service is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.
  When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Service to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration, latest_ready_revison, trafficStatuses, and uri will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state.
  If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: traffic and trafficStatuses, observedGeneration and generation, latestReadyRevision and latestCreatedRevision.
  If reconciliation failed, trafficStatuses, observedGeneration, and latestReadyRevision will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created Services. Additional information on the failure can be found in terminalCondition and conditions.

* `etag` -
  A system-generated fingerprint for this version of the resource. May be used to detect modification conflict during updates.
