# google_network_security_mirroring_deployment

A deployment represents a zonal mirroring backend ready to accept
GENEVE-encapsulated replica traffic, e.g. a zonal instance group fronted by
an internal passthrough load balancer. Deployments are always part of a
global deployment group which represents a global mirroring service.

  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `forwarding_rule` -
  (Required)
  The regional forwarding rule that fronts the mirroring collectors, for
  example: `projects/123456789/regions/us-central1/forwardingRules/my-rule`.
  See https://google.aip.dev/124.

* `mirroring_deployment_group` -
  (Required)
  The deployment group that this deployment is a part of, for example:
  `projects/123456789/locations/global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/my-dg`.
  See https://google.aip.dev/124.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The cloud location of the deployment, e.g. `us-central1-a` or `asia-south1-b`.

* `mirroring_deployment_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID to use for the new deployment, which will become the final
  component of the deployment's resource name.


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels are key/value pairs that help to organize and filter resources.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  User-provided description of the deployment.
  Used as additional context for the deployment.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`

* `name` -
  The resource name of this deployment, for example:
  `projects/123456789/locations/us-central1-a/mirroringDeployments/my-dep`.
  See https://google.aip.dev/122 for more details.

* `create_time` -
  The timestamp when the resource was created.
  See https://google.aip.dev/148#timestamps.

* `update_time` -
  The timestamp when the resource was most recently updated.
  See https://google.aip.dev/148#timestamps.

* `state` -
  The current state of the deployment.
  See https://google.aip.dev/216.
  Possible values:
  STATE_UNSPECIFIED
  ACTIVE
  CREATING
  DELETING
  OUT_OF_SYNC
  DELETE_FAILED

* `reconciling` -
  The current state of the resource does not match the user's intended state,
  and the system is working to reconcile them. This part of the normal
  operation (e.g. linking a new association to the parent group).
  See https://google.aip.dev/128.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


MirroringDeployment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import MirroringDeployment using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    location = "<-required value->"
    mirroringDeploymentId = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_network_security_mirroring_deployment.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MirroringDeployment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}"
  to = google_network_security_mirroring_deployment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), MirroringDeployment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_security_mirroring_deployment.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/mirroringDeployments/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
$ terraform import google_network_security_mirroring_deployment.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
$ terraform import google_network_security_mirroring_deployment.default {{location}}/{{mirroring_deployment_id}}
```
