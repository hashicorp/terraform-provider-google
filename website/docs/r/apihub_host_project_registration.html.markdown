# google_apihub_host_project_registration

Host project registration refers to the registration of a Google cloud project with API hub as a host project.
This is the project where API hub is provisioned.
It acts as the consumer project for the API hub instance provisioned.
Multiple runtime projects can be attached to the host project and these attachments define the scope of API hub.



## Example Usage - Apihub Host Project Registration Basic


```hcl
resource "google_project" "project" {
    name       = "apihub-proj"
    project_id = "apihub-proj"
    org_id     = "123456789"
    billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
    deletion_policy = "DELETE"
}

resource "time_sleep" "wait_60_seconds" {
    create_duration = "60s"
    depends_on = [google_project.project]
}

# Enable API hub API
resource "google_project_service" "apihub_service" {
    project = google_project.project.project_id
    service = "apihub.googleapis.com"
    depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_60_seconds]
}

resource "google_apihub_host_project_registration" "apihub_host_project"{
    project = google_project.project.project_id
    location = "asia-south1"
    host_project_registration_id = google_project.project.project_id
    gcp_project = "projects/${google_project.project.project_id}"

    depends_on = [google_project_service.apihub_service]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `gcp_project` -
  (Required)
  Required. Immutable. Google cloud project name in the format: "projects/abc" or "projects/123".
  As input, project name with either project id or number are accepted.
  As output, this field will contain project number.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  Part of `parent`. See documentation of `projectsId`.

* `host_project_registration_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. The ID to use for the Host Project Registration, which will become the
  final component of the host project registration's resource name. The ID
  must be the same as the Google cloud project specified in the
  host_project_registration.gcp_project field.


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/hostProjectRegistrations/{{host_project_registration_id}}`

* `name` -
  Identifier. The name of the host project registration.
  Format:
  "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/hostProjectRegistrations/{host_project_registration}".

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The time at which the host project registration was created.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


HostProjectRegistration can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/hostProjectRegistrations/{{host_project_registration_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{host_project_registration_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{host_project_registration_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import HostProjectRegistration using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/hostProjectRegistrations/{{host_project_registration_id}}"
  to = google_apihub_host_project_registration.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), HostProjectRegistration can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apihub_host_project_registration.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/hostProjectRegistrations/{{host_project_registration_id}}
$ terraform import google_apihub_host_project_registration.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{host_project_registration_id}}
$ terraform import google_apihub_host_project_registration.default {{location}}/{{host_project_registration_id}}
```
