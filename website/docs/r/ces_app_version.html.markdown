  service agent
  `service-@gcp-sa-ces.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

* `key_name` -
  (Output)
  The parameter name or the header name of the API key.

* `service_account` -
  (Output)
  The email address of the service account used for authenticatation. CES
  uses this service account to exchange an access token and the access token
  is then sent in the `Authorization` header of the request.
  The service account must have the
  `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role granted to the
  CES service agent
  `service-@gcp-sa-ces.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

<a name="nested_snapshot_toolsets_open_api_toolset_api_authentication_bearer_token_config"></a>The `bearer_token_config` block contains:

* `cert` -
  (Output)
  The allowed custom CA certificates (in DER format) for
  HTTPS verification. This overrides the default SSL trust store. If this
  is empty or unspecified, CES will use Google's default trust
  store to verify certificates. N.B. Make sure the HTTPS server
  certificates are signed with "subject alt name". For instance a
  certificate can be self-signed using the following command,
  openssl x509 -req -days 200 -in example.com.csr \
  -signkey example.com.key \
  -out example.com.crt \
  -extfile <(printf "\nsubjectAltName='DNS:www.example.com'")

* `display_name` -
  (Output)
  The name of the allowed custom CA certificates. This
  can be used to disambiguate the custom CA certificates.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


AppVersion can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/apps/{{app}}/versions/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{app}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{app}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import AppVersion using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/apps/{{app}}/versions/{{name}}"
  to = google_ces_app_version.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), AppVersion can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_ces_app_version.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/apps/{{app}}/versions/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_ces_app_version.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{app}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_ces_app_version.default {{location}}/{{app}}/{{name}}
```
