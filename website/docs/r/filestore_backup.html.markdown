  tier = "BASIC_SSD"

  file_shares {
    capacity_gb = 2560
    name        = "share1"
  }

  networks {
    network = "default"
    modes   = ["MODE_IPV4"]
    connect_mode = "DIRECT_PEERING"

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the backup. The name must be unique within the specified instance.
  The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `source_instance` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the source Cloud Filestore instance, in the format projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/instances/{instanceId}, used to create this backup.

* `source_file_share` -
  (Required)
  Name of the file share in the source Cloud Filestore instance that the backup is created from.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The name of the location of the instance. This can be a region for ENTERPRISE tier instances.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}`

* `state` -
  The backup state.

* `create_time` -
  The time when the snapshot was created in RFC3339 text format.

* `capacity_gb` -
  The amount of bytes needed to allocate a full copy of the snapshot content.

* `storage_bytes` -
  The size of the storage used by the backup. As backups share storage, this number is expected to change with backup creation/deletion.

* `source_instance_tier` -
  The service tier of the source Cloud Filestore instance that this backup is created from.

* `download_bytes` -
  Amount of bytes that will be downloaded if the backup is restored.

* `kms_key_name` -
  KMS key name used for data encryption.
