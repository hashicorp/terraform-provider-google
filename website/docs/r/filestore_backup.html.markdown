```hcl
resource "google_filestore_instance" "instance" {
  name     = "tf-fs-inst"
  location = "us-central1-b"
  tier     = "BASIC_HDD"

  file_shares {
    capacity_gb = 1024
    name        = "share1"
  }

  networks {
    network      = "default"
    modes        = ["MODE_IPV4"]
    connect_mode = "DIRECT_PEERING"
  }
}

resource "google_filestore_backup" "backup" {
  name              = "tf-fs-bkup"
  location          = "us-central1"
  description       = "This is a filestore backup for the test instance"
  source_instance   = google_filestore_instance.instance.id
  source_file_share = "share1"

  labels = {
    "files":"label1",
    "other-label": "label2"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the backup. The name must be unique within the specified instance.
  The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `source_instance` -
  (Required)
  The resource name of the source Cloud Filestore instance, in the format projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/instances/{instanceId}, used to create this backup.

* `source_file_share` -
  (Required)
  Name of the file share in the source Cloud Filestore instance that the backup is created from.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The name of the location of the instance. This can be a region for ENTERPRISE tier instances.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}`

* `state` -
  The backup state.

* `create_time` -
  The time when the snapshot was created in RFC3339 text format.

* `capacity_gb` -
  The amount of bytes needed to allocate a full copy of the snapshot content.

* `storage_bytes` -
  The size of the storage used by the backup. As backups share storage, this number is expected to change with backup creation/deletion.

* `source_instance_tier` -
  The service tier of the source Cloud Filestore instance that this backup is created from.

* `download_bytes` -
  Amount of bytes that will be downloaded if the backup is restored.

* `kms_key_name` -
  KMS key name used for data encryption.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

## Import


Backup can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Backup using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}"
  to = google_filestore_backup.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Backup can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_filestore_backup.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_filestore_backup.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_filestore_backup.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
