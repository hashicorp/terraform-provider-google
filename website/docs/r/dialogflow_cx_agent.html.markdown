# google_dialogflow_cx_agent

Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the user in a natural way.


To get more information about Agent, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `git_integration_settings.github_settings.access_token`.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `location` -
  (Required)
  The name of the location this agent is located in.
  ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
   This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
   Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.

* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  The human-readable name of the agent, unique within the location.

* `default_language_code` -
  (Required)
  The default language of the agent as a language tag. [See Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/language)
  for a list of the currently supported language codes. This field cannot be updated after creation.

* `time_zone` -
  (Required)
  The time zone of this agent from the [time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), e.g., America/New_York,
  Europe/Paris.


* `supported_language_codes` -
  (Optional)
  The list of all languages supported by this agent (except for the default_language_code).

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  The description of this agent. The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.

* `avatar_uri` -
  (Optional)
  The URI of the agent's avatar. Avatars are used throughout the Dialogflow console and in the self-hosted Web Demo integration.

* `speech_to_text_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Settings related to speech recognition.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_speech_to_text_settings).

* `security_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the SecuritySettings reference for the agent. Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/securitySettings/<Security Settings ID>.

* `enable_stackdriver_logging` -
  (Optional, Deprecated)
  Determines whether this agent should log conversation queries.

  ~> **Warning:** `enable_stackdriver_logging` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please use `advanced_settings.logging_settings.enable_stackdriver_logging`instead.

* `enable_spell_correction` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates if automatic spell correction is enabled in detect intent requests.

* `advanced_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Hierarchical advanced settings for this agent. The settings exposed at the lower level overrides the settings exposed at the higher level.
  Hierarchy: Agent->Flow->Page->Fulfillment/Parameter.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_advanced_settings).

* `git_integration_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Git integration settings for this agent.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_git_integration_settings).

* `text_to_speech_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Settings related to speech synthesizing.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_text_to_speech_settings).

* `gen_app_builder_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Gen App Builder-related agent-level settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_gen_app_builder_settings).

* `start_playbook` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the start playbook in this agent. A start playbook will be automatically created when the agent is created, and can only be deleted by deleting the agent. Format: **projects/<ProjectID>/locations/<LocationID>/agents/<AgentID>/playbooks/<PlaybookID>**. Currently only the default playbook with id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" is allowed.

* `enable_multi_language_training` -
  (Optional)
  Enable training multi-lingual models for this agent. These models will be trained on all the languages supported by the agent.

* `locked` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates whether the agent is locked for changes. If the agent is locked, modifications to the agent will be rejected except for [agents.restore][].

* `answer_feedback_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Answer feedback collection settings.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_answer_feedback_settings).

* `personalization_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Settings for end user personalization.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_personalization_settings).

* `client_certificate_settings` -
  (Optional)
  Settings for custom client certificates.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_client_certificate_settings).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `delete_chat_engine_on_destroy` - (Optional) If set to `true`, Terraform will delete the chat engine associated with the agent when the agent is destroyed.
Otherwise, the chat engine will persist.

This virtual field addresses a critical dependency chain: `agent` -> `engine` -> `data store`. The chat engine is automatically
provisioned when a data store is linked to the agent, meaning Terraform doesn't have direct control over its lifecycle as a managed
resource. This creates a problem when both the agent and data store are managed by Terraform and need to be destroyed. Without
delete_chat_engine_on_destroy set to true, the data store's deletion would fail because the unmanaged chat engine would still be
using it. This setting ensures that the entire dependency chain can be properly torn down.
See `mmv1/templates/terraform/examples/dialogflowcx_tool_data_store.tf.tmpl` as an example.

Data store can be linked to an agent through the `knowledgeConnectorSettings` field of a [flow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.flows#resource:-flow)
or a [page](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.flows.pages#resource:-page)
or the `dataStoreSpec` field of a [tool](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.tools#resource:-tool).
The ID of the implicitly created engine is stored in the `genAppBuilderSettings` field of the [agent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents#resource:-agent).

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Agent using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/agents/{{name}}"
  to = google_dialogflow_cx_agent.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Agent can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_dialogflow_cx_agent.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/agents/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_dialogflow_cx_agent.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_dialogflow_cx_agent.default {{location}}/{{name}}
