## Example Usage - Eventarc Enrollment With Pipeline Destination


```hcl
resource "google_eventarc_enrollment" "primary" {
  location      = "us-central1"
  enrollment_id = "some-enrollment"
  message_bus   = google_eventarc_message_bus.primary.id
  destination   = google_eventarc_pipeline.pipeline.id
  cel_match     = "message.type == 'google.cloud.dataflow.job.v1beta3.statusChanged'"
}

resource "google_eventarc_pipeline" "pipeline" {
  location    = "us-central1"
  pipeline_id = "some-pipeline"
  destinations {
    http_endpoint {
      uri = "https://10.77.0.0:80/route"
    }
    network_config {
      network_attachment = "projects/my-project-name/regions/us-central1/networkAttachments/some-network-attachment"
    }
  }
}

resource "google_eventarc_message_bus" "message_bus" {
  location       = "us-central1"
  message_bus_id = "some-message-bus"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `message_bus` -
  (Required)
  Resource name of the message bus identifying the source of the messages. It
  matches the form
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/messageBuses/{messageBus}.

* `cel_match` -
  (Required)
  A CEL expression identifying which messages this enrollment applies to.

* `destination` -
  (Required)
  Destination is the Pipeline that the Enrollment is delivering to. It must
  point to the full resource name of a Pipeline. Format:
  "projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{region}/pipelines/{PIPELINE_ID)"

* `location` -
  (Required)
  Resource ID segment making up resource `name`. It identifies the resource within its parent collection as described in https://google.aip.dev/122.

* `enrollment_id` -
  (Required)
  The user-provided ID to be assigned to the Enrollment. It should match the
  format `^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$`.

* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  Resource display name.

* `labels` -

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/enrollments/{{enrollment_id}}`

* `name` -
  Resource name of the form
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/enrollments/{enrollment}

* `etag` -
  This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other
  fields, and might be sent only on update and delete requests to ensure that
  the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.

* `create_time` -
  The creation time.

* `update_time` -
  The last-modified time.

* `uid` -

## Import


Enrollment can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/enrollments/{{enrollment_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{enrollment_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{enrollment_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Enrollment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/enrollments/{{enrollment_id}}"
  to = google_eventarc_enrollment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Enrollment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_eventarc_enrollment.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/enrollments/{{enrollment_id}}
$ terraform import google_eventarc_enrollment.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{enrollment_id}}
$ terraform import google_eventarc_enrollment.default {{location}}/{{enrollment_id}}
```
