# google_ml_engine_model
~> **Warning:** This resource is deprecated at the API level and will be removed in a future version of Terraform.

Represents a machine learning solution.

A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained model
ready to receive prediction requests. The model itself is just a container.


To get more information about Model, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.models)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/deploying-models)

## Example Usage - Ml Model Basic


```hcl
resource "google_ml_engine_model" "default" {
  name        = "default"
  description = "My model"
  regions     = ["us-central1"]
}
```
## Example Usage - Ml Model Full


```hcl
resource "google_ml_engine_model" "default" {
  name        = "default"
  description = "My model"
  regions     = ["us-central1"]
  labels = {
    my_model = "foo"
  }
  online_prediction_logging         = true
  online_prediction_console_logging = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name specified for the model.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  The description specified for the model when it was created.

* `default_version` -
  (Optional)
  The default version of the model. This version will be used to handle
  prediction requests that do not specify a version.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_default_version).

* `regions` -
  (Optional)
  The list of regions where the model is going to be deployed.
  Currently only one region per model is supported

* `online_prediction_logging` -
  (Optional)
  If true, online prediction access logs are sent to StackDriver Logging.

* `online_prediction_console_logging` -
  (Optional)
  If true, online prediction nodes send stderr and stdout streams to Stackdriver Logging

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  One or more labels that you can add, to organize your models.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_default_version"></a>The `default_version` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name specified for the version when it was created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/models/{{name}}`

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Model can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/models/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Model using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/models/{{name}}"
  to = google_ml_engine_model.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Model can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_ml_engine_model.default projects/{{project}}/models/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_ml_engine_model.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_ml_engine_model.default {{name}}
```
