## Example Usage - Network Connectivity Hub Basic


```hcl
resource "google_network_connectivity_hub" "primary"  {
 name        = "basic"
 description = "A sample hub"
 labels = {
    label-one = "value-one"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The name of the hub. Hub names must be unique. They use the following form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/global/hubs/{hub_id}`


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional labels in key:value format. For more information about labels, see [Requirements for labels](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements).
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of the hub.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/hubs/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The time the hub was created.

* `update_time` -
  Output only. The time the hub was last updated.

* `unique_id` -
  Output only. The Google-generated UUID for the hub. This value is unique across all hub resources. If a hub is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new hub is assigned a different unique_id.

* `state` -
  Output only. The current lifecycle state of this hub.

* `routing_vpcs` -
  The VPC network associated with this hub's spokes. All of the VPN tunnels, VLAN attachments, and router appliance instances referenced by this hub's spokes must belong to this VPC network. This field is read-only. Network Connectivity Center automatically populates it based on the set of spokes attached to the hub.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_routing_vpcs).

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


<a name="nested_routing_vpcs"></a>The `routing_vpcs` block contains:

* `uri` -
  (Optional)
  The URI of the VPC network.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


Hub can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/hubs/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Hub using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/global/hubs/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_connectivity_hub.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Hub can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_hub.default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/hubs/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_hub.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_hub.default {{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
