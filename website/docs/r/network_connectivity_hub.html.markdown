## Example Usage - basic_hub
A basic test of a networkconnectivity hub
```hcl
resource "google_network_connectivity_hub" "primary" {
  name        = "hub"
  description = "A sample hub"

  labels = {
    label-one = "value-one"
  }

  project = "my-project-name"
}


```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Immutable. The name of the hub. Hub names must be unique. They use the following form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/global/hubs/{hub_id}`
  


- - -

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of the hub.
  
* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional labels in key:value format. For more information about labels, see [Requirements for labels](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements).
  
* `project` -
  (Optional)
  The project for the resource
  


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/hubs/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The time the hub was created.
  
* `routing_vpcs` -
  The VPC network associated with this hub's spokes. All of the VPN tunnels, VLAN attachments, and router appliance instances referenced by this hub's spokes must belong to this VPC network. This field is read-only. Network Connectivity Center automatically populates it based on the set of spokes attached to the hub.
  
* `state` -
  Output only. The current lifecycle state of this hub. Possible values: STATE_UNSPECIFIED, CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETING
  
* `unique_id` -
  Output only. The Google-generated UUID for the hub. This value is unique across all hub resources. If a hub is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new hub is assigned a different unique_id.
  
* `update_time` -
  Output only. The time the hub was last updated.
