}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `resource` -
  (Required)
  The resource for which BPA needs to be created

* `backup_plan` -
  (Required)
  The BP with which resource needs to be created
  Note:
  - A Backup Plan configured for 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance', can only protect instance type resources.
  - A Backup Plan configured for 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' can be used to protect both standard Disks and Regional Disks resources.

* `resource_type` -
  (Required)
  The resource type of workload on which backupplan is applied.
  Examples include, "compute.googleapis.com/Instance", "compute.googleapis.com/Disk", and "compute.googleapis.com/RegionDisk"

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the backupplan association

* `backup_plan_association_id` -
  (Required)
  The id of backupplan association


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`

* `name` -
  The name of backup plan association resource created

* `create_time` -
  The time when the instance was created

* `update_time` -
  The time when the instance was updated.

* `data_source` -
  Resource name of data source which will be used as storage location for backups taken

* `rules_config_info` -
  Message for rules config info
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rules_config_info).

* `last_successful_backup_consistency_time` -
  The point in time when the last successful backup was captured from the source


<a name="nested_rules_config_info"></a>The `rules_config_info` block contains:

* `rule_id` -
  (Output)
  Backup Rule id fetched from backup plan.

* `last_backup_state` -
  (Output)
  State of last backup taken.

* `last_backup_error` -
  (Output)
  google.rpc.Status object to store the last backup error
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rules_config_info_last_backup_error).


<a name="nested_rules_config_info_last_backup_error"></a>The `last_backup_error` block contains:

* `code` -
  (Output)
  The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code]

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


BackupPlanAssociation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import BackupPlanAssociation using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    location = "<-required value->"
    backup_plan_association_id = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_backup_dr_backup_plan_association.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import BackupPlanAssociation using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}"
  to = google_backup_dr_backup_plan_association.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), BackupPlanAssociation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan_association.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlanAssociations/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan_association.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan_association.default {{location}}/{{backup_plan_association_id}}
```
