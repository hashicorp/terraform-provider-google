# google_dataplex_entry

An entry represents a data asset for which you capture metadata, such as a BigQuery table.
The primary constituents of an entry are aspects, which provide thematically coherent information.
Examples include a table's schema, sensitive data protection profile, data quality information, or a simple tag.

**Important Considerations:**

* There is a limit of 99 aspects per entry.
* The entry resource has to use project numbers and not project IDs. Therefore, if
  a dependency was already provisioned using project ID, it needs to be referenced explicitly as a resource name
  containing the project number.


To get more information about Entry, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.entryGroups.entries)
* How-to Guides
    * [Manage entries and ingest custom sources](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources)

## Example Usage - Dataplex Entry Basic


```hcl
resource "google_dataplex_entry_group" "entry-group-basic" {
  entry_group_id = "entry-group-basic"
  project = "1111111111111"
  location = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_dataplex_entry_type" "entry-type-basic" {
  entry_type_id = "entry-type-basic"
  project = "1111111111111"
  location = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_dataplex_entry" "test_basic" {
  entry_group_id = google_dataplex_entry_group.entry-group-basic.entry_group_id
  project = "1111111111111"
  location = "us-central1"
  entry_id = "entry-basic"
  entry_type = google_dataplex_entry_type.entry-type-basic.name
}
```

## Import


Entry can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryGroups/{{entry_group_id}}/entries/{{entry_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{entry_group_id}}/{{entry_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{entry_group_id}}/{{entry_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Entry using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryGroups/{{entry_group_id}}/entries/{{entry_id}}"
  to = google_dataplex_entry.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Entry can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_dataplex_entry.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/entryGroups/{{entry_group_id}}/entries/{{entry_id}}
$ terraform import google_dataplex_entry.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{entry_group_id}}/{{entry_id}}
$ terraform import google_dataplex_entry.default {{location}}/{{entry_group_id}}/{{entry_id}}
```
