# google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic

Controls traffic configuration for a backend.



## Example Usage - Firebase App Hosting Traffic Target


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic" "example" {
  project          = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.project
  location         = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.location
  backend          = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.backend_id

  target {
    splits {
      build = google_firebase_app_hosting_build.example.name
      percent = 100
    }
  }
}

resource "google_firebase_app_hosting_build" "example" {
  project          = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.project

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location the Backend that this Traffic config applies to

* `backend` -
  (Required)
  Id of the backend that this Traffic config applies to


* `target` -
  (Optional)
  Set to manually control the desired traffic for the backend. This will
  cause current to eventually match this value. The percentages must add
  up to 100.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target).

* `rollout_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The policy for how builds and rollouts are triggered and rolled out.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rollout_policy).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_target"></a>The `target` block supports:

* `splits` -
  (Required)
  A list of traffic splits that together represent where traffic is being routed.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target_splits).


<a name="nested_target_splits"></a>The `splits` block supports:

* `build` -
  (Required)
  The build that traffic is being routed to.

* `percent` -
  (Required)
  The percentage of traffic to send to the build. Currently must be 100 or 0.

<a name="nested_rollout_policy"></a>The `rollout_policy` block supports:

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  A flag that, if true, prevents rollouts from being created via this RolloutPolicy.

* `disabled_time` -
  (Output)
  If disabled is set, the time at which the rollouts were disabled.

* `codebase_branch` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a branch that triggers a new build to be started with this
  policy. If not set, no automatic rollouts will happen.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/traffic`

* `etag` -
  Server-computed checksum based on other values; may be sent
  on update or delete to ensure operation is done on expected resource.

* `uid` -
  System-assigned, unique identifier.

* `create_time` -
  Time at which the backend was created.

* `update_time` -
  Time at which the backend was last updated.

* `delete_time` -
  Time at which the backend was deleted.

* `name` -
  Identifier. The resource name of the backend traffic config
  Format:
  `projects/{project}/locations/{locationId}/backends/{backendId}/traffic`.

* `current` -
  Current state of traffic allocation for the backend.
  When setting `target`, this field may differ for some time until the desired state is reached.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_current).


<a name="nested_current"></a>The `current` block contains:

* `splits` -
  (Output)
  A list of traffic splits that together represent where traffic is being routed.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_current_splits).


<a name="nested_current_splits"></a>The `splits` block contains:

* `build` -
  (Output)
  The build that traffic is being routed to.

* `percent` -
  (Output)
  The percentage of traffic to send to the build. Currently must be 100 or 0.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Traffic can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/traffic`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backend}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Traffic using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/traffic"
  to = google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Traffic can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/traffic
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_traffic.default {{location}}/{{backend}}
```
