## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


Automation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{delivery_pipeline}}/automations/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Automation using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    name = "<-required value->"
    location = "<-required value->"
    delivery_pipeline = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_clouddeploy_automation.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Automation using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{delivery_pipeline}}/automations/{{name}}"
  to = google_clouddeploy_automation.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Automation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_automation.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{delivery_pipeline}}/automations/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_automation.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_automation.default {{location}}/{{delivery_pipeline}}/{{name}}
```
