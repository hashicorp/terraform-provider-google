# google_clouddeploy_target

The Cloud Deploy `Target` resource

## Example Usage - multi_target
tests creating and updating a multi-target
```hcl
resource "google_clouddeploy_target" "primary" {
  location = "us-west1"
  name     = "target"

  annotations = {
    my_first_annotation = "example-annotation-1"

    my_second_annotation = "example-annotation-2"
  }

  deploy_parameters = {}
  description       = "multi-target description"

  execution_configs {
    usages            = ["RENDER", "DEPLOY"]
    execution_timeout = "3600s"
  }

  labels = {
    my_first_label = "example-label-1"

    my_second_label = "example-label-2"
  }

  multi_target {
    target_ids = ["1", "2"]
  }

  project          = "my-project-name"
  require_approval = false
  provider = google-beta
}

```
## Example Usage - run_target
tests creating and updating a cloud run target
```hcl
resource "google_clouddeploy_target" "primary" {
  location = "us-west1"
  name     = "target"

  annotations = {
    my_first_annotation = "example-annotation-1"

    my_second_annotation = "example-annotation-2"
  }

  deploy_parameters = {}
  description       = "basic description"

  execution_configs {
    usages            = ["RENDER", "DEPLOY"]
    execution_timeout = "3600s"
  }

  labels = {
    my_first_label = "example-label-1"

    my_second_label = "example-label-2"
  }

  project          = "my-project-name"
  require_approval = false

  run {
    location = "projects/my-project-name/locations/us-west1"
  }
  provider = google-beta
}

```
## Example Usage - target
Creates a basic Cloud Deploy target
```hcl
resource "google_clouddeploy_target" "primary" {
  location = "us-west1"
  name     = "target"

  annotations = {
    my_first_annotation = "example-annotation-1"

    my_second_annotation = "example-annotation-2"
  }

  deploy_parameters = {
    deployParameterKey = "deployParameterValue"
  }

  description = "basic description"

  gke {
    cluster = "projects/my-project-name/locations/us-west1/clusters/example-cluster-name"
  }

  labels = {
    my_first_label = "example-label-1"

    my_second_label = "example-label-2"
  }

  project          = "my-project-name"
  require_approval = false
}


```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource
  
* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the `Target`. Format is [a-z][a-z0-9\-]{0,62}.
  


- - -

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used by the user, and not by Google Cloud Deploy. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations for more details such as format and size limitations.
  
* `anthos_cluster` -
  (Optional)
  Information specifying an Anthos Cluster.
  
* `deploy_parameters` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The deploy parameters to use for this target.
  
* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Description of the `Target`. Max length is 255 characters.
  
* `execution_configs` -
  (Optional)
  Configurations for all execution that relates to this `Target`. Each `ExecutionEnvironmentUsage` value may only be used in a single configuration; using the same value multiple times is an error. When one or more configurations are specified, they must include the `RENDER` and `DEPLOY` `ExecutionEnvironmentUsage` values. When no configurations are specified, execution will use the default specified in `DefaultPool`.
  
* `gke` -
  (Optional)
  Information specifying a GKE Cluster.
  
* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Google Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels. Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be <= 128 bytes.
  
* `multi_target` -
  (Optional)
  Information specifying a multiTarget.
  
* `project` -
  (Optional)
  The project for the resource
  
* `require_approval` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Whether or not the `Target` requires approval.
  
* `run` -
  (Optional)
  Information specifying a Cloud Run deployment target.
  


The `anthos_cluster` block supports:
    
* `membership` -
  (Optional)
  Membership of the GKE Hub-registered cluster to which to apply the Skaffold configuration. Format is `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/memberships/{membership_name}`.
    
The `execution_configs` block supports:
    
* `artifact_storage` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Cloud Storage location in which to store execution outputs. This can either be a bucket ("gs://my-bucket") or a path within a bucket ("gs://my-bucket/my-dir"). If unspecified, a default bucket located in the same region will be used.
    
* `execution_timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Execution timeout for a Cloud Build Execution. This must be between 10m and 24h in seconds format. If unspecified, a default timeout of 1h is used.
    
* `service_account` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Google service account to use for execution. If unspecified, the project execution service account (-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com) is used.
    
* `usages` -
  (Required)
  Required. Usages when this configuration should be applied.
    
* `worker_pool` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The resource name of the `WorkerPool`, with the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{worker_pool}`. If this optional field is unspecified, the default Cloud Build pool will be used.
    
The `gke` block supports:
    
* `cluster` -
  (Optional)
  Information specifying a GKE Cluster. Format is `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}.
    
* `internal_ip` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. If true, `cluster` is accessed using the private IP address of the control plane endpoint. Otherwise, the default IP address of the control plane endpoint is used. The default IP address is the private IP address for clusters with private control-plane endpoints and the public IP address otherwise. Only specify this option when `cluster` is a [private GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept).
    
The `multi_target` block supports:
    
* `target_ids` -
  (Required)
  Required. The target_ids of this multiTarget.
    
The `run` block supports:
    
* `location` -
  (Required)
  Required. The location where the Cloud Run Service should be located. Format is `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`.
    
## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/targets/{{name}}`

* `create_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the `Target` was created.
  
* `etag` -
  Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  
* `target_id` -
  Output only. Resource id of the `Target`.
  
* `uid` -
  Output only. Unique identifier of the `Target`.
  
* `update_time` -
  Output only. Most recent time at which the `Target` was updated.
