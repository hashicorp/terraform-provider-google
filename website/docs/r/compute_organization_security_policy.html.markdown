## Import


OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}`
* `{{policy_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import OrganizationSecurityPolicy using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    policy_id = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_compute_organization_security_policy.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OrganizationSecurityPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}"
  to = google_compute_organization_security_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), OrganizationSecurityPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_organization_security_policy.default locations/global/securityPolicies/{{policy_id}}
$ terraform import google_compute_organization_security_policy.default {{policy_id}}
```
