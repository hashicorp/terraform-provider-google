## Example Usage - Container Analysis Note Basic


```hcl
resource "google_container_analysis_note" "note" {
  name = "attestor-note"
  attestation_authority {
    hint {
      human_readable_name = "Attestor Note"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Container Analysis Note Attestation Full


```hcl
resource "google_container_analysis_note" "note" {
  name = "attestor-note"

  short_description = "test note"
  long_description = "a longer description of test note"
  expiration_time = "2120-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"

  related_url {
    url = "some.url"
    label = "foo"
  }

  related_url {
    url = "google.com"
  }

  attestation_authority {
    hint {
      human_readable_name = "Attestor Note"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the note.

* `attestation_authority` -
  (Required)
  Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
  For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
  "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
  grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
  grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
  gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
  Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
  Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
  project.
  Structure is documented below.


The `attestation_authority` block supports:

* `hint` -
  (Required)
  This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
  the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
  resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
  name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
  from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
  these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
  in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
  Attestations to verify.
  Structure is documented below.


The `hint` block supports:

* `human_readable_name` -
  (Required)
  The human readable name of this Attestation Authority, for
  example "qa".

- - -


* `short_description` -
  (Optional)
  A one sentence description of the note.

* `long_description` -
  (Optional)
  A detailed description of the note

* `related_url` -
  (Optional)
  URLs associated with this note and related metadata.
  Structure is documented below.

* `expiration_time` -
  (Optional)
  Time of expiration for this note. Leave empty if note does not expire.

* `related_note_names` -
  (Optional)
  Names of other notes related to this note.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `related_url` block supports:

* `url` -
  (Required)
  Specific URL associated with the resource.

* `label` -
  (Optional)
  Label to describe usage of the URL

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/notes/{{name}}`

* `kind` -
  The type of analysis this note describes

* `create_time` -
  The time this note was created.

* `update_time` -
  The time this note was last updated.

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.
