## Example Usage - Logging Saved Query Basic


```hcl
resource "google_logging_saved_query" "saved_query" {
  name         = "my-saved-query"
  display_name = "My Saved Query"
  parent       = "projects/my-project-name"
  location     = "global"
  description  = "A saved query"
  logging_query {
    filter = "resource.type=gce_instance"
  }
  visibility = "SHARED"
}
```
## Example Usage - Logging Saved Query Private


```hcl
resource "google_logging_saved_query" "saved_query" {
  name         = "my-saved-query-private"
  display_name = "My Saved Query"
  parent       = "projects/my-project-name"
  location     = "global"
  description  = "A saved query"
  logging_query {
    filter = "resource.type=gce_instance"
  }
  visibility = "PRIVATE"
}
```
## Example Usage - Logging Saved Query Summary Fields


```hcl
resource "google_logging_saved_query" "saved_query" {
  name         = "my-saved-query-summary-fields"
  display_name = "My Saved Query"
  parent       = "projects/my-project-name"
  location     = "global"
  description  = "A saved query"
  logging_query {
    filter = "resource.type=gce_instance"
    summary_fields {
      field = "jsonPayload.paymentId"
    }
    summary_fields {
      field = "jsonPayload.errorMessage"
    }
    summary_field_start = 100 # truncates after the first 100 characters
  }
  visibility = "SHARED"
}
```
## Example Usage - Logging Saved Query Sql Basic


```hcl
resource "google_logging_saved_query" "saved_query" {

  parent       = "projects/my-project-name"
  location     = "global"
  description  = "A saved query"
  ops_analytics_query {
    sql_query_text = <<-EOT
SELECT
  timestamp, log_name, severity, json_payload, resource, labels
FROM
  VIEW
WHERE
  timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
LIMIT 100
EOT
  }
  visibility = "SHARED"
}
