  (Required)
  Specification of the field containing the timestamp of scanned items. Used for data sources like Datastore and BigQuery.
  For BigQuery: Required to filter out rows based on the given start and end times. If not specified and the table was

  (Required)
  Set of files to scan.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_file_set).

* `bytes_limit_per_file` -
  (Optional)
  Max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a scanned file's size is bigger than this value
  then the rest of the bytes are omitted.

* `bytes_limit_per_file_percent` -
  (Optional)
  Max percentage of bytes to scan from a file. The rest are omitted. The number of bytes scanned is rounded down.
  Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

* `files_limit_percent` -
  (Optional)
  Limits the number of files to scan to this percentage of the input FileSet. Number of files scanned is rounded down.
  Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit.

* `file_types` -
  (Optional)
  List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data
  format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well.
  Images are scanned only as binary if the specified region does not support image inspection and no fileTypes were specified.
  Each value may be one of `BINARY_FILE`, `TEXT_FILE`, `IMAGE`, `WORD`, `PDF`, `AVRO`, `CSV`, and `TSV`.

* `sample_method` -
  (Optional)
  How to sample bytes if not all bytes are scanned. Meaningful only when used in conjunction with bytesLimitPerFile.

* `url` -
  (Optional)
  The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format `gs://<bucket>/<path>`. Trailing wildcard
  in the path is allowed.
  If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned
  non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that `gs://mybucket/` is
  equivalent to `gs://mybucket/*`, and `gs://mybucket/directory/` is equivalent to `gs://mybucket/directory/*`.

* `regex_file_set` -
  (Optional)
  The regex-filtered set of files to scan.

  A list of regular expressions matching file paths to include. All files in the bucket
  that match at least one of these regular expressions will be included in the set of files,
  except for those that also match an item in excludeRegex. Leaving this field empty will
  match all files by default (this is equivalent to including .* in the list)

* `exclude_regex` -
  (Optional)
  A list of regular expressions matching file paths to exclude. All files in the bucket that match at
  least one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the scan.

  specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig.

* `rows_limit_percent` -
  (Optional)
  Max percentage of rows to scan. The rest are omitted. The number of rows scanned is rounded down. 
  Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of 
  rowsLimit and rowsLimitPercent can be specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig.

* `sample_method` -
  (Optional)
  How to sample rows if not all rows are scanned. Meaningful only when used in conjunction with either
