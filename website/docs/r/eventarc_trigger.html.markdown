## Example Usage - Eventarc Trigger With Cloud Run Destination


```hcl
resource "google_eventarc_trigger" "primary" {
  name     = "some-trigger"
  location = "us-central1"
  matching_criteria {
    attribute = "type"
    value     = "google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished"
  }
  destination {
    cloud_run_service {
      service = google_cloud_run_service.default.name
      region  = "us-central1"
    }
  }
  labels = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
  transport {
    pubsub {
      topic = google_pubsub_topic.foo.id
    }
  }
}

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "foo" {
  name = "some-topic"
}

resource "google_cloud_run_service" "default" {
  name     = "some-service"
  location = "us-central1"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "gcr.io/cloudrun/hello"
        ports {
          container_port = 8080
        }
      }
      container_concurrency = 50
      timeout_seconds       = 100
    }
  }

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Required. The resource name of the trigger. Must be unique within the location on the project.

* `matching_criteria` -
  (Required)
  Required. null The list of filters that applies to event attributes. Only events that match all the provided filters will be sent to the destination.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_matching_criteria).

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_destination).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource


* `service_account` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The IAM service account email associated with the trigger. The service account represents the identity of the trigger. The principal who calls this API must have `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission in the service account. See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#sa_common for more information. For Cloud Run destinations, this service account is used to generate identity tokens when invoking the service. See https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/pubsub-push#create-service-account for information on how to invoke authenticated Cloud Run services. In order to create Audit Log triggers, the service account should also have `roles/eventarc.eventReceiver` IAM role.

* `transport` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. In order to deliver messages, Eventarc may use other GCP products as transport intermediary. This field contains a reference to that transport intermediary. This information can be used for debugging purposes.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_transport).

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. User labels attached to the triggers that can be used to group resources.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `channel` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The name of the channel associated with the trigger in `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/channels/{channel}` format. You must provide a channel to receive events from Eventarc SaaS partners.

* `event_data_content_type` -
