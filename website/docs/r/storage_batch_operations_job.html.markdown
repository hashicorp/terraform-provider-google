## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 120 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 120 minutes.

## Import


Job can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/jobs/{{job_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{job_id}}`
* `{{job_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Job using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    jobId = "<-optional value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_storage_batch_operations_job.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Job using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/global/jobs/{{job_id}}"
  to = google_storage_batch_operations_job.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Job can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_storage_batch_operations_job.default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/jobs/{{job_id}}
$ terraform import google_storage_batch_operations_job.default {{project}}/{{job_id}}
$ terraform import google_storage_batch_operations_job.default {{job_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
