# google\_privateca\_certificate\_authority

A CertificateAuthority represents an individual Certificate Authority. A
CertificateAuthority can be used to create Certificates.

  (Optional)
  The Tier of this CertificateAuthority.
  Default value is `ENTERPRISE`.
  Possible values are `ENTERPRISE` and `DEVOPS`.

* `lifetime` -
  (Optional)
  The desired lifetime of the CA certificate. Used to create the "notBeforeTime" and
