# google\_privateca\_certificate\_authority

A CertificateAuthority represents an individual Certificate Authority. A
CertificateAuthority can be used to create Certificates.


To get more information about CertificateAuthority, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/reference/rest)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service)

~> **Warning:** On newer versions of the provider, you must explicitly set `deletion_protection=false`
(and run `terraform apply` to write the field to state) in order to destroy a CertificateAuthority.
It is recommended to not set this field (or set it to true) until you're ready to destroy.
