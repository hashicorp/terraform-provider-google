# google\_dataproc\_job

Manages a job resource within a Dataproc cluster within GCE. For more information see
[the official dataproc documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/).

!> **Note:** This resource does not support 'update' and changing any attributes will cause the resource to be recreated.

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "google_dataproc_cluster" "mycluster" {
  name   = "dproc-cluster-unique-name"
  region = "us-central1"
}

# Submit an example spark job to a dataproc cluster
resource "google_dataproc_job" "spark" {
  region       = google_dataproc_cluster.mycluster.region
  force_delete = true
  placement {
    cluster_name = google_dataproc_cluster.mycluster.name
  }

  spark_config {
    main_class    = "org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi"
    jar_file_uris = ["file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar"]
    args          = ["1000"]

    properties = {
      "spark.logConf" = "true"
    }

    logging_config {
      driver_log_levels = {
        "root" = "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Submit an example pyspark job to a dataproc cluster
resource "google_dataproc_job" "pyspark" {
  region       = google_dataproc_cluster.mycluster.region
  force_delete = true
  placement {
    cluster_name = google_dataproc_cluster.mycluster.name
  }

  pyspark_config {
    main_python_file_uri = "gs://dataproc-examples-2f10d78d114f6aaec76462e3c310f31f/src/pyspark/hello-world/hello-world.py"
    properties = {
      "spark.logConf" = "true"
    }
  }
}

# Check out current state of the jobs
output "spark_status" {
  value = google_dataproc_job.spark.status[0].state
}

output "pyspark_status" {
  value = google_dataproc_job.pyspark.status[0].state
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `placement.cluster_name` - (Required) The name of the cluster where the job 
   will be submitted.

* `xxx_config` - (Required) Exactly one of the specific job types to run on the
   cluster should be specified. If you want to submit multiple jobs, this will
   currently require the definition of multiple `google_dataproc_job` resources
   as shown in the example above, or by setting the `count` attribute.
   The following job configs are supported:

       * pyspark_config  - Submits a PySpark job to the cluster
       * spark_config    - Submits a Spark job to the cluster
       * hadoop_config   - Submits a Hadoop job to the cluster
       * hive_config     - Submits a Hive job to the cluster
       * hpig_config     - Submits a Pig job to the cluster
       * sparksql_config - Submits a Spark SQL job to the cluster

- - -

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the `cluster` can be found and jobs
   subsequently run against. If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `region` - (Optional) The Cloud Dataproc region. This essentially determines which clusters are available
   for this job to be submitted to. If not specified, defaults to `global`.

* `force_delete` - (Optional) By default, you can only delete inactive jobs within
   Dataproc. Setting this to true, and calling destroy, will ensure that the
   job is first cancelled before issuing the delete.

* `labels` - (Optional) The list of labels (key/value pairs) to add to the job.

* `scheduling.max_failures_per_hour` - (Required) Maximum number of times per hour a driver may be restarted as a result of driver terminating with non-zero code before job is reported failed.

The `pyspark_config` block supports:

Submitting a pyspark job to the cluster. Below is an example configuration:

```hcl
# Submit a pyspark job to the cluster
resource "google_dataproc_job" "pyspark" {
  ...

    main_python_file_uri = "gs://dataproc-examples-2f10d78d114f6aaec76462e3c310f31f/src/pyspark/hello-world/hello-world.py"
    properties = {
      "spark.logConf" = "true"
    }
  }
