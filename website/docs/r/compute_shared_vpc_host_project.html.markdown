# google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project

Enables the Google Compute Engine
[Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc)
feature for a project, assigning it as a Shared VPC host project.

For more information, see,
[the Project API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/projects),
where the Shared VPC feature is referred to by its former name "XPN".

## Example Usage

```hcl
# A host project provides network resources to associated service projects.
resource "google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project" "host" {
  project = "host-project-id"
}

# A service project gains access to network resources provided by its
# associated host project.
resource "google_compute_shared_vpc_service_project" "service1" {
  host_project    = google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project.host.project
  service_project = "service-project-id-1"
}

resource "google_compute_shared_vpc_service_project" "service2" {
  host_project    = google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project.host.project
  service_project = "service-project-id-2"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are expected:

* `project` - (Required) The ID of the project that will serve as a Shared VPC host project

## Import

Google Compute Engine Shared VPC host project feature can be imported using the `project`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project.host host-project-id
```
