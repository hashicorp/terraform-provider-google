# google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route

Policy-based Routes are more powerful routes that route L4 network traffic based on not just destination IP, but also source IP, protocol and more. A Policy-based Route always take precedence when it conflicts with other types of routes.


To get more information about PolicyBasedRoute, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.policyBasedRoutes)
* How-to Guides
    * [Use policy-based routes](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/use-policy-based-routes#api)

## Example Usage - Network Connectivity Policy Based Route Basic


```hcl
resource "google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route" "default" {
  name = "my-pbr"
  network = google_compute_network.my_network.id
  filter {
    protocol_version = "IPV4"
  }
  next_hop_other_routes = "DEFAULT_ROUTING"
}

resource "google_compute_network" "my_network" {
  name                    = "my-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}
```

## Example Usage - Network Connectivity Policy Based Route Full


```hcl
resource "google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route" "default" {
  name = "my-pbr"
  description = "My routing policy"
  network = google_compute_network.my_network.id
  priority = 2302

  filter {
    protocol_version = "IPV4"
    ip_protocol = "UDP"
    src_range = "10.0.0.0/24"
    dest_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
  next_hop_ilb_ip = google_compute_global_address.ilb.address

  virtual_machine {
    tags = ["restricted"]
  }

  labels = {
    env = "default"
  }
}

resource "google_compute_network" "my_network" {
  name                    = "my-network"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

# This example substitutes an arbitrary internal IP for an internal network
# load balancer for brevity. Consult https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal
# to set one up.
resource "google_compute_global_address" "ilb" {
  name = "my-ilb"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the policy based route.

* `network` -
  (Required)
  Fully-qualified URL of the network that this route applies to, for example: projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network.

* `filter` -
  (Required)
  The filter to match L4 traffic.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_filter).


<a name="nested_filter"></a>The `filter` block supports:

* `protocol_version` -
  (Required)
  Internet protocol versions this policy-based route applies to.
  Possible values are: `IPV4`.

* `ip_protocol` -
  (Optional)
  The IP protocol that this policy-based route applies to. Valid values are 'TCP', 'UDP', and 'ALL'. Default is 'ALL'.

* `src_range` -
  (Optional)
  The source IP range of outgoing packets that this policy-based route applies to. Default is "0.0.0.0/0" if protocol version is IPv4.

* `dest_range` -
  (Optional)
  The destination IP range of outgoing packets that this policy-based route applies to. Default is "0.0.0.0/0" if protocol version is IPv4.

- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  User-defined labels.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `next_hop_other_routes` -
  (Optional)
  Other routes that will be referenced to determine the next hop of the packet.
  Possible values are: `DEFAULT_ROUTING`.

* `next_hop_ilb_ip` -
  (Optional)
  The IP address of a global-access-enabled L4 ILB that is the next hop for matching packets.

* `priority` -
  (Optional)
  The priority of this policy-based route. Priority is used to break ties in cases where there are more than one matching policy-based routes found. In cases where multiple policy-based routes are matched, the one with the lowest-numbered priority value wins. The default value is 1000. The priority value must be from 1 to 65535, inclusive.

* `virtual_machine` -
  (Optional)
  VM instances to which this policy-based route applies to.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_virtual_machine).

* `interconnect_attachment` -
  (Optional)
  The interconnect attachments that this policy-based route applies to.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_interconnect_attachment).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_virtual_machine"></a>The `virtual_machine` block supports:

* `tags` -
  (Required)
  A list of VM instance tags that this policy-based route applies to. VM instances that have ANY of tags specified here will install this PBR.

<a name="nested_interconnect_attachment"></a>The `interconnect_attachment` block supports:

* `region` -
  (Required)
  Cloud region to install this policy-based route on for Interconnect attachments. Use `all` to install it on all Interconnect attachments.

* `create_time` -
  Time when the policy-based route was created.

* `update_time` -
  Time when the policy-based route was created.

* `kind` -
  Type of this resource.

* `warnings` -
  If potential misconfigurations are detected for this route, this field will be populated with warning messages.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_warnings).

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


<a name="nested_warnings"></a>The `warnings` block contains:

* `code` -
  (Output)
  A warning code, if applicable.

* `data` -
  (Output)
  Metadata about this warning in key: value format. The key should provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement.

* `warning_message` -
  (Output)
  A human-readable description of the warning code.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


PolicyBasedRoute can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyBasedRoutes/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{name}}`
* `{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import PolicyBasedRoute using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyBasedRoutes/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), PolicyBasedRoute can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route.default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/policyBasedRoutes/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route.default {{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_connectivity_policy_based_route.default {{name}}
```
