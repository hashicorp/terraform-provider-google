## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Basic


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
  dataset_id                  = "example_dataset"
  friendly_name               = "test"
  description                 = "This is a test description"
  location                    = "EU"
  default_table_expiration_ms = 3600000

  labels = {
    env = "default"
  }

  access {
    role          = "OWNER"
    user_by_email = "Joe@example.com"
  }
  access {
    role   = "READER"
    domain = "example.com"
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Cmek


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
  dataset_id                  = "example_dataset"
  friendly_name               = "test"
  description                 = "This is a test description"
  location                    = "US"
  default_table_expiration_ms = 3600000

  default_encryption_configuration {
    kms_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.crypto_key.self_link
  }
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "crypto_key" {
  name     = "example-key"
  key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.key_ring.self_link
}

resource "google_kms_key_ring" "key_ring" {
  name     = "example-keyring"
  location = "us"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `dataset_id` -
  (Required)
  A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID
  must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or
  underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.


- - -


* `access` -
  (Optional)
  An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities.  Structure is documented below.

* `default_table_expiration_ms` -
  (Optional)
  The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds.
  The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour).

  Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
  will have an `expirationTime` property set to the creation time plus
  the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
  new tables, not existing ones. When the `expirationTime` for a given
  table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
  If a table's `expirationTime` is modified or removed before the
  table expires, or if you provide an explicit `expirationTime` when
  creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
  expiration time indicated by this property.

* `default_partition_expiration_ms` -
  (Optional)
  The default partition expiration for all partitioned tables in
  the dataset, in milliseconds.

  Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in
  the dataset will have an `expirationMs` property in the `timePartitioning`
  settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
  affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
  have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
  Setting this property overrides the use of `defaultTableExpirationMs`
  for partitioned tables: only one of `defaultTableExpirationMs` and
  `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` will be used for any new partitioned
  table. If you provide an explicit `timePartitioning.expirationMs` when
  creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
  over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A user-friendly description of the dataset

* `friendly_name` -
  (Optional)
  A descriptive name for the dataset

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to
  organize and group your datasets

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  The geographic location where the dataset should reside.
  See [official docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations).

  There are two types of locations, regional or multi-regional. A regional
  location is a specific geographic place, such as Tokyo, and a multi-regional
  location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
  contains at least two geographic places.

  Possible regional values include: `asia-east1`, `asia-northeast1`,
  `asia-southeast1`, `australia-southeast1`, `europe-north1`,
  `europe-west2` and `us-east4`.

  Possible multi-regional values: `EU` and `US`.

  The default value is multi-regional location `US`.
  Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `default_encryption_configuration` -
  (Optional)
  The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. Once this property is set,
  all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to
  this value, unless table creation request (or query) overrides the key.  Structure is documented below.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `delete_contents_on_destroy` - (Optional) If set to `true`, delete all the tables in the
dataset when destroying the resource; otherwise,
destroying the resource will fail if tables are present.

The `access` block supports:

* `domain` -
  (Optional)
  A domain to grant access to. Any users signed in with the
  domain specified will be granted the specified access

* `group_by_email` -
  (Optional)
  An email address of a Google Group to grant access to.

* `role` -
  (Optional)
  Describes the rights granted to the user specified by the other
  member of the access object. Primitive, Predefined and custom
  roles are supported. Predefined roles that have equivalent
  primitive roles are swapped by the API to their Primitive
  counterparts, and will show a diff post-create. See
  [official docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).

* `special_group` -
  (Optional)
  A special group to grant access to.

  Possible values include:

  * `projectOwners`: Owners of the enclosing project.

  * `projectReaders`: Readers of the enclosing project.

  * `projectWriters`: Writers of the enclosing project.

  * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: All authenticated BigQuery users.

* `user_by_email` -
  (Optional)
  An email address of a user to grant access to. For example:
  fred@example.com

* `view` -
  (Optional)
  A view from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
  executed against that view will have read access to tables in
  this dataset. The role field is not required when this field is
  set. If that view is updated by any user, access to the view
  needs to be granted again via an update operation.  Structure is documented below.


The `view` block supports:

* `dataset_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the dataset containing this table.

* `project_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the project containing this table.

* `table_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the table. The ID must contain only letters (a-z,
  A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length
  is 1,024 characters.

The `default_encryption_configuration` block supports:

* `kms_key_name` -
  (Required)
  Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination
  BigQuery table. The BigQuery Service Account associated with your project requires
  access to this encryption key.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `creation_time` -
  The time when this dataset was created, in milliseconds since the
  epoch.

* `etag` -
  A hash of the resource.

* `last_modified_time` -
  The date when this dataset or any of its tables was last modified, in
  milliseconds since the epoch.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Dataset can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_bigquery_dataset.default projects/{{project}}/datasets/{{dataset_id}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_dataset.default {{project}}/{{dataset_id}}
$ terraform import google_bigquery_dataset.default {{dataset_id}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
