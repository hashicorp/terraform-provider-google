# google\_cloud\_run\_domain\_mapping

Resource to hold the state and status of a user's domain mapping.


To get more information about DomainMapping, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.domainmappings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains)

## Example Usage - Cloud Run Domain Mapping Basic


```hcl

resource "google_cloud_run_service" "default" {
  name     = "cloudrun-srv"
  location = "us-central1"

  metadata {
    namespace = "my-project-name"
  }

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_run_domain_mapping" "default" {
  location = "us-central1"
  name     = "verified-domain.com"

  metadata {
    namespace = "my-project-name"
  }

  spec {
    route_name = google_cloud_run_service.default.name
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name should be a [verified](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080) domain

* `spec` -
  (Required)
  The spec for this DomainMapping.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_spec).

* `metadata` -
  (Required)
  Metadata associated with this DomainMapping.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_metadata).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the cloud run instance. eg us-central1


<a name="nested_spec"></a>The `spec` block supports:

* `force_override` -
  (Optional)
  If set, the mapping will override any mapping set before this spec was set.
  It is recommended that the user leaves this empty to receive an error
  warning about a potential conflict and only set it once the respective UI
  has given such a warning.

* `route_name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the Cloud Run Service that this DomainMapping applies to.
  The route must exist.

* `certificate_mode` -
  (Optional)
  The mode of the certificate.
  Default value is `AUTOMATIC`.
  Possible values are `NONE` and `AUTOMATIC`.

<a name="nested_metadata"></a>The `metadata` block supports:

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
  (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
  and routes.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

* `generation` -
  A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.

* `resource_version` -
  An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that
  can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used
  for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
  resource or set of resources. They may only be valid for a
  particular resource or set of resources.
  More info:
  https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

* `self_link` -
  SelfLink is a URL representing this object.

* `uid` -
  UID is a unique id generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
  allowed to change on PUT operations.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

* `namespace` -
  (Required)
  In Cloud Run the namespace must be equal to either the
  project ID or project number.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Annotations is a key value map stored with a resource that
  may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. More
  info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
  **Note**: The Cloud Run API may add additional annotations that were not provided in your config.
  If terraform plan shows a diff where a server-side annotation is added, you can add it to your config
  or apply the lifecycle.ignore_changes rule to the metadata.0.annotations field.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `locations/{{location}}/namespaces/{{project}}/domainmappings/{{name}}`

* `status` -
  The current status of the DomainMapping.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_status).


<a name="nested_status"></a>The `status` block contains:

* `conditions` -
  Array of observed DomainMappingConditions, indicating the current state
  of the DomainMapping.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conditions).

* `observed_generation` -
  ObservedGeneration is the 'Generation' of the DomainMapping that
  was last processed by the controller.

* `resource_records` -
  (Optional)
  The resource records required to configure this domain mapping. These
  records must be added to the domain's DNS configuration in order to
  serve the application via this domain mapping.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_resource_records).

* `mapped_route_name` -
  The name of the route that the mapping currently points to.


<a name="nested_conditions"></a>The `conditions` block contains:

* `message` -
