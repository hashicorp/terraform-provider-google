## Example Usage - Cloud Run Domain Mapping Basic


```hcl

resource "google_cloud_run_service" "default" {
  name     = "tftest-cloudrun"
  location = "us-central1"

  metadata {
    namespace = "my-project-name"
  }

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "gcr.io/cloudrun/hello"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_run_domain_mapping" "default" {
  location = "us-central1"
  name     = "verified-domain.com"

  metadata {
    namespace = "my-project-name"
  }

  spec {
    route_name = google_cloud_run_service.default.name
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name should be a verified domain

* `spec` -
  (Required)
  The spec for this DomainMapping.  Structure is documented below.

* `metadata` -
  (Required)
  Metadata associated with this DomainMapping.  Structure is documented below.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the cloud run instance. eg us-central1


The `spec` block supports:

* `force_override` -
  (Optional)
  If set, the mapping will override any mapping set before this spec was set.
  It is recommended that the user leaves this empty to receive an error
  warning about a potential conflict and only set it once the respective UI
  has given such a warning.

* `route_name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the Cloud Run Service that this DomainMapping applies to.
  The route must exist.

* `certificate_mode` -
  (Optional)
  The mode of the certificate.

The `metadata` block supports:

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
  (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
  and routes.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

* `generation` -
  A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.

* `resource_version` -
  An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that
  can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used
  for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
  resource or set of resources. They may only be valid for a
  particular resource or set of resources.
  More info:
  https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

* `self_link` -
  SelfLink is a URL representing this object.

* `uid` -
  UID is a unique id generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
  allowed to change on PUT operations.
  More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

* `namespace` -
  (Required)
  In Cloud Run the namespace must be equal to either the
  project ID or project number.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Annotations is a key value map stored with a resource that
  may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. More
  info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

- - -


* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `locations/{{location}}/namespaces/{{project}}/domainmappings/{{name}}`

* `status` -
  The current status of the DomainMapping.  Structure is documented below.


The `status` block contains:

* `conditions` -
  Array of observed DomainMappingConditions, indicating the current state
  of the DomainMapping.  Structure is documented below.

* `observed_generation` -
  ObservedGeneration is the 'Generation' of the DomainMapping that
  was last processed by the controller.

* `resource_records` -
  (Optional)
  The resource records required to configure this domain mapping. These
  records must be added to the domain's DNS configuration in order to
  serve the application via this domain mapping.  Structure is documented below.

* `mapped_route_name` -

- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

DomainMapping can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_cloud_run_domain_mapping.default locations/{{location}}/namespaces/{{project}}/domainmappings/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_cloud_run_domain_mapping.default {{location}}/{{project}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_cloud_run_domain_mapping.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
