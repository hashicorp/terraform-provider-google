# google_firebase_app_hosting_build

A single build for a backend, at a specific point codebase reference tag
and point in time. Encapsulates several resources, including an Artifact Registry
container image, a Cloud Build invocation that built the image, and the
Cloud Run revision that uses that image.



## Example Usage - Firebase App Hosting Build Minimal


```hcl
resource "google_firebase_app_hosting_build" "example" {
  project          = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.project
  location         = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.location
  backend          = google_firebase_app_hosting_backend.example.backend_id
  build_id         = "mini-build"

  source {
    container {
      image = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello"
    }
  }
}

resource "google_firebase_app_hosting_backend" "example" {
  project          = "my-project-name"
  # Choose the region closest to your users

  location         = "us-central1"
  backend_id       = "mini"
  app_id           = "1:0000000000:web:674cde32020e16fbce9dbd"
  serving_locality = "GLOBAL_ACCESS"
  service_account  = google_service_account.service_account.email

  depends_on = [google_project_service.fah]
}

### Include these blocks only once per project if you are starting from scratch ###
resource "google_service_account" "service_account" {
  project = "my-project-name"

  # Must be firebase-app-hosting-compute
  account_id                   = "firebase-app-hosting-compute"
  display_name                 = "Firebase App Hosting compute service account"

  # Do not throw if already exists
  create_ignore_already_exists = true
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "app_hosting_sa_runner" {
  project = "my-project-name"

  # For App Hosting
  role   = "roles/firebaseapphosting.computeRunner"
  member = google_service_account.service_account.member
}

  project = "my-project-name"
  service = "firebaseapphosting.googleapis.com"
}

  The Artifact Registry
  [container
  image](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.repositories.dockerImages)

* `environment` -
  The environment name of the backend when this build was created.

* `error` -
  The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
  three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
  You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
  [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_error).

* `effective_annotations` -
  All of annotations (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


<a name="nested_error"></a>The `error` block contains:

* `code` -
  (Output)
  The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

* `message` -
  (Output)
  A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
  user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
  google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

* `details` -
  (Output)
  A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of
  message types for APIs to use.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Build can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/builds/{{build_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Build using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/builds/{{build_id}}"
  to = google_firebase_app_hosting_build.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Build can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_build.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backends/{{backend}}/builds/{{build_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_build.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}
$ terraform import google_firebase_app_hosting_build.default {{location}}/{{backend}}/{{build_id}}
```
