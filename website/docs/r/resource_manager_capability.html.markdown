# google_resource_manager_capability

An app-enabled folder is a folder within the Google Cloud resource hierarchy that has been configured for application management. This folder lets you define and manage App Hub applications. These applications are functional groupings of services and workloads that span multiple projects within that folder and its descendant projects.

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest)

  parent           = "organizations/123456789"
  deletion_protection = false
}
resource "time_sleep" "wait_60s" {
  depends_on = [google_folder.folder]
  create_duration = "60s"
}
resource "google_resource_manager_capability" "capability" {
  value            = true
  parent           = "${google_folder.folder.name}"
  capability_name  = "app-management"
  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_60s]
}
```

[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Capability can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{parent}}/capabilities/{{capability_name}}`
* `{{parent}}/{{capability_name}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Capability using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    parent = "<-required value->"
    capability_name = "<-required value->"
  }
  to = google_resource_manager_capability.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Capability using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{parent}}/capabilities/{{capability_name}}"
  to = google_resource_manager_capability.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Capability can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_resource_manager_capability.default {{parent}}/capabilities/{{capability_name}}
$ terraform import google_resource_manager_capability.default {{parent}}/{{capability_name}}
```
