# google\_compute\_region\_backend\_service

A Region Backend Service defines a regionally-scoped group of virtual
machines that will serve traffic for load balancing.

Region backend services can only be used when using internal load balancing.
For external load balancing, use a global backend service instead.


To get more information about RegionBackendService, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/regionBackendServices)
* How-to Guides
    * [Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/internal/)

## Example Usage - Region Backend Service Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_region_backend_service" "default" {
  name                            = "region-backend-service"
  region                          = "us-central1"
  health_checks                   = ["${google_compute_health_check.default.self_link}"]
  connection_draining_timeout_sec = 10
  session_affinity                = "CLIENT_IP"
}

resource "google_compute_health_check" "default" {
  name               = "health-check"
  check_interval_sec = 1
  timeout_sec        = 1

  tcp_health_check {
    port = "80"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `health_checks` -
  (Required)
  The list of HealthChecks for checking the health of the backend service.
  Currently at most one health check can be specified, and a health check
  is required.


- - -


* `backend` -
  (Optional)
  The list of backends that serve this RegionBackendService.  Structure is documented below.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `protocol` -
  (Optional)
  The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
  The possible values are TCP and UDP, and the default is TCP.

* `session_affinity` -
  (Optional)
  Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.
  Can be NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO.
  When the protocol is UDP, this field is not used.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The Region in which the created backend service should reside.
  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.

* `timeout_sec` -
  (Optional)
  How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
  failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].

* `connection_draining_timeout_sec` -
  (Optional)
  Time for which instance will be drained (not accept new
  connections, but still work to finish started).

* `load_balancing_scheme` -
  (Optional)
  This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can only
  be INTERNAL for RegionBackendServices
* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `backend` block supports:

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.
  Provide this property when you create the resource.

* `group` -
  (Optional)
  The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group. This defines the list
  of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
  instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
  the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
  are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
  Note that you must specify an Instance Group
  resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
  partial URL.
  The instance group must be within the same region as the BackendService.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `fingerprint` -
  Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this
  object. This field is used in optimistic locking.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

RegionBackendService can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_region_backend_service.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/backendServices/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_region_backend_service.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_region_backend_service.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
