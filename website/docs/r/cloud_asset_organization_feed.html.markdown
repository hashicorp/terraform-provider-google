* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs)

## Example Usage - Cloud Asset Organization Feed


```hcl
# Create a feed that sends notifications about network resource updates under a
# particular organization.
resource "google_cloud_asset_organization_feed" "organization_feed" {
  billing_project = "my-project-name"
  org_id          = "123456789"
  feed_id         = "network-updates"
  content_type    = "RESOURCE"

  asset_types = [
    "compute.googleapis.com/Subnetwork",
    "compute.googleapis.com/Network",
  ]

  feed_output_config {
    pubsub_destination {
      topic = google_pubsub_topic.feed_output.id
    }
  }

  condition {
    expression = <<-EOT
    !temporal_asset.deleted &&
    temporal_asset.prior_asset_state == google.cloud.asset.v1.TemporalAsset.PriorAssetState.DOES_NOT_EXIST
    EOT
    title = "created"
    description = "Send notifications on creation events"
  }
}

# The topic where the resource change notifications will be sent.
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "feed_output" {
  project  = "my-project-name"
  name     = "network-updates"
}

# Find the project number of the project whose identity will be used for sending
# the asset change notifications.
data "google_project" "project" {
  project_id = "my-project-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `billing_project` -
  (Required)
  The project whose identity will be used when sending messages to the
  destination pubsub topic. It also specifies the project for API 
  enablement check, quota, and billing.

* `feed_id` -
  (Required)
  This is the client-assigned asset feed identifier and it needs to be unique under a specific parent.

* `feed_output_config` -
  (Required)
  Output configuration for asset feed destination.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_feed_output_config).

* `org_id` -
  (Required)
  The organization this feed should be created in.


<a name="nested_feed_output_config"></a>The `feed_output_config` block supports:

* `pubsub_destination` -
  (Required)
  Destination on Cloud Pubsub.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_pubsub_destination).


<a name="nested_pubsub_destination"></a>The `pubsub_destination` block supports:

* `topic` -
  (Required)
  Destination on Cloud Pubsub topic.

- - -


* `asset_names` -
  (Optional)
  A list of the full names of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of 
  assetNames and assetTypes. Only asset updates matching specified assetNames and assetTypes are
  exported to the feed. For example: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1.
  See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resourceNames#fullResourceName for more info.

* `asset_types` -
  (Optional)
  A list of types of the assets to receive updates. You must specify either or both of assetNames
  and assetTypes. Only asset updates matching specified assetNames and assetTypes are exported to
  the feed. For example: "compute.googleapis.com/Disk"
  See https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for a list of all
  supported asset types.

* `content_type` -
  (Optional)
  Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name and type will be returned.
  Possible values are `CONTENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`, `RESOURCE`, `IAM_POLICY`, `ORG_POLICY`, and `ACCESS_POLICY`.

* `condition` -
  (Optional)
  A condition which determines whether an asset update should be published. If specified, an asset
  will be returned only when the expression evaluates to true. When set, expression field
  must be a valid CEL expression on a TemporalAsset with name temporal_asset. Example: a Feed with
  expression "temporal_asset.deleted == true" will only publish Asset deletions. Other fields of
  condition are optional.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_condition).


<a name="nested_condition"></a>The `condition` block supports:

* `expression` -
  (Required)
  Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.

* `title` -
  (Optional)
  Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.
  This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression,
  e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file 
  name and a position in the file.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

* `name` -
  The format will be organizations/{organization_number}/feeds/{client-assigned_feed_identifier}.
