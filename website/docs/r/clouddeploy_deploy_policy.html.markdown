  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `suspended` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. When suspended, the policy will not prevent actions from occurring, even if the action violates the policy.

  Output only. Time at which the DeployPolicy was created.

* `update_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the DeployPolicy was updated.

* `etag` -
  Optional. The weak etag of the `DeployPolicy` resource. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.

* `effective_annotations` -
  All of annotations (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


DeployPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DeployPolicy using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}"
  to = google_clouddeploy_deploy_policy.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), DeployPolicy can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_deploy_policy.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deployPolicies/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_deploy_policy.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_clouddeploy_deploy_policy.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
