Budget configuration for a billing account.


To get more information about Budget, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/budget/rest/v1/billingAccounts.budgets)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a budget](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)

~> **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
in the provider configuration. Otherwise the Billing Budgets API will return a 403 error.
Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
`billing_project` you defined.

## Example Usage - Billing Budget Basic


```hcl
data "google_billing_account" "account" {
  billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
}

resource "google_billing_budget" "budget" {
  billing_account = data.google_billing_account.account.id
  display_name = "Example Billing Budget"
  amount {
    specified_amount {
      currency_code = "USD"
      units = "100000"
    }
  }
  threshold_rules {
      threshold_percent =  0.5
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Billing Budget Lastperiod


```hcl
data "google_billing_account" "account" {
  billing_account = "000000-0000000-0000000-000000"
}

data "google_project" "project" {
}

resource "google_billing_budget" "budget" {
  billing_account = data.google_billing_account.account.id
  display_name = "Example Billing Budget"
  
  budget_filter {
    projects = ["projects/${data.google_project.project.number}"]
  }

  amount {
    last_period_amount = true
  }

  threshold_rules {
      threshold_percent =  10.0
      # Typically threshold_percent would be set closer to 1.0 (100%).
      # It has been purposely set high (10.0 / 1000%) in this example
      # so it does not trigger alerts during automated testing.
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Billing Budget Filter
