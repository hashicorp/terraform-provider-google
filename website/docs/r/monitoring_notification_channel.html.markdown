# google\_monitoring\_notification\_channel

A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
labels are required.

A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.

## Example Usage - Notification Channel Basic


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_notification_channel" "basic" {
  display_name = "Test Notification Channel"
  type         = "email"
  labels = {
    email_address = "fake_email@blahblah.com"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `type` -
  (Required)
  The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field. See https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list to get the list of valid values such as "email", "slack", etc...

* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
  permissible and required labels are specified in the
  NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
  **Note**: Some NotificationChannelDescriptor labels are
  sensitive and the API will return an partially-obfuscated value.
  For example, for `"type": "slack"` channels, an `auth_token`
  label with value "SECRET" will be obfuscated as "**CRET". In order
  to avoid a diff, Terraform will use the state value if it appears
  that the obfuscated value matches the state value in
  length/unobfuscated characters. However, Terraform will not detect a
  a diff if the obfuscated portion of the value was changed outside of
  Terraform.

* `user_labels` -
  (Optional)
  User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional human-readable description of this notification channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.

* `enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `name` -
  The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
  projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
  The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.

* `verification_status` -
  Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

NotificationChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_monitoring_notification_channel.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
