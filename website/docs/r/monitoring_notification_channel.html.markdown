# google\_monitoring\_notification\_channel

A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
labels are required.

A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.


To get more information about NotificationChannel, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels)
* How-to Guides
    * [Notification Options](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options)
    * [Monitoring API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including `sensitive_labels.auth_token`, `sensitive_labels.password`, and `sensitive_labels.service_key` will be stored in the raw
state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Notification Channel Basic


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_notification_channel" "basic" {
  display_name = "Test Notification Channel"
  type         = "email"
  labels = {
    email_address = "fake_email@blahblah.com"
  }
  force_delete = false
}
```
## Example Usage - Notification Channel Sensitive


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_notification_channel" "default" {
  display_name = "Test Slack Channel"
  type         = "slack"
  labels = {
    "channel_name" = "#foobar"
  }
  sensitive_labels {
    auth_token = "one"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `type` -
  (Required)
  The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field. See https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list to get the list of valid values such as "email", "slack", etc...


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
  permissible and required labels are specified in the
  NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
  Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot
  determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
  the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.

* `sensitive_labels` -
  (Optional)
  Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the `labels` field on this
  resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
  sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
  in the `labels` map in the api request.
  Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
  to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_sensitive_labels).

* `user_labels` -
  (Optional)
  User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional human-readable description of this notification channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.

* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.

* `enabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `force_delete` - (Optional) If true, the notification channel will be deleted regardless
of its use in alert policies (the policies will be updated
to remove the channel). If false, channels that are still
referenced by an existing alerting policy will fail to be
deleted in a delete operation.


<a name="nested_sensitive_labels"></a>The `sensitive_labels` block supports:

* `auth_token` -
  (Optional)
  An authorization token for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: slack
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `password` -
  (Optional)
  An password for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: webhook_basicauth
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `service_key` -
  (Optional)
  An servicekey token for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: pagerduty
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

* `name` -
  The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
  projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
  The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.

* `verification_status` -
  Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.
