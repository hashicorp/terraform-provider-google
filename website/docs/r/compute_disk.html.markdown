# google\_compute\_disk

Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
storage space requirements.

Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
  you create the resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels to apply to this disk.  A list of key->value pairs.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `size` -
  (Optional)
  Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
  field when creating a persistent disk using the `image` or
  `snapshot` parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
  persistent disk.
  If you specify this field along with `image` or `snapshot`,
  the value must not be less than the size of the image
  or the size of the snapshot.
  ~>**NOTE** If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size
  if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested.
  You can add `lifecycle.prevent_destroy` in the config to prevent destroying
  and recreating.

* `physical_block_size_bytes` -
  (Optional)
  Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present
  in a request, a default value is used. Currently supported sizes
  are 4096 and 16384, other sizes may be added in the future.
  If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list
  the supported values for the caller's project.

* `interface` -
  (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html), Deprecated)
  Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI.

  ~> **Warning:** `interface` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. This field is no longer used and can be safely removed from your configurations; disk interfaces are automatically determined on attachment.

* `source_disk` -
  (Optional)
  The source disk used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource.
  For example, the following are valid values:
  * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk}
  * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/disks/{disk}
  * projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/disks/{disk}
  * projects/{project}/regions/{region}/disks/{disk}
  * zones/{zone}/disks/{disk}
  * regions/{region}/disks/{disk}

* `type` -
  (Optional)
  URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to
  create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk.

* `image` -
  (Optional)
  The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be
  one of: the image's `self_link`, `projects/{project}/global/images/{image}`,
  `projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}`, `global/images/{image}`,
  `global/images/family/{family}`, `family/{family}`, `{project}/{family}`,
  `{project}/{image}`, `{family}`, or `{image}`. If referred by family, the
  images names must include the family name. If they don't, use the
  [google_compute_image data source](/docs/providers/google/d/compute_image.html).
  For instance, the image `centos-6-v20180104` includes its family name `centos-6`.
  These images can be referred by family name here.

* `resource_policies` -
  (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
  Resource policies applied to this disk for automatic snapshot creations.
  ~>**NOTE** This value does not support updating the
  resource policy, as resource policies can not be updated more than
  one at a time. Use
  [`google_compute_disk_resource_policy_attachment`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_disk_resource_policy_attachment)
  to allow for updating the resource policy attached to the disk.

* `enable_confidential_compute` -
  (Optional)
  Whether this disk is using confidential compute mode.
  Note: Only supported on hyperdisk skus, disk_encryption_key is required when setting to true

* `multi_writer` -
  (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html))
  Indicates whether or not the disk can be read/write attached to more than one instance.

* `provisioned_iops` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates how many IOPS must be provisioned for the disk.
  Note: Updating currently is only supported by hyperdisk skus without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk
  allows for an update of IOPS every 4 hours. To update your hyperdisk more frequently, you'll need to manually delete and recreate it

* `provisioned_throughput` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates how much Throughput must be provisioned for the disk.
  Note: Updating currently is only supported by hyperdisk skus without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk
  allows for an update of Throughput every 4 hours. To update your hyperdisk more frequently, you'll need to manually delete and recreate it

* `async_primary_disk` -
  (Optional)
  A nested object resource
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_async_primary_disk).

* `guest_os_features` -
  (Optional)
  A list of features to enable on the guest operating system.
  Applicable only for bootable disks.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_guest_os_features).

* `licenses` -
  (Optional)
  Any applicable license URI.

* `zone` -
  (Optional)
  A reference to the zone where the disk resides.

* `source_image_encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if
  the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_source_image_encryption_key).

* `disk_encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
  After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
  provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
  snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
  Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
  the disk.
  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
  the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
  you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_disk_encryption_key).

* `snapshot` -
  (Optional)
  The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
  a partial or full URL to the resource. If the snapshot is in another
  project than this disk, you must supply a full URL. For example, the
  following are valid values:
  * `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot`
  * `projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot`
  * `global/snapshots/snapshot`
  * `snapshot`

* `source_snapshot_encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
  if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
  key.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_source_snapshot_encryption_key).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

  The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
  internally during updates.

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `last_attach_timestamp` -
  Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `last_detach_timestamp` -
  Last detach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `users` -
  Links to the users of the disk (attached instances) in form:
  project/zones/zone/instances/instance
