HttpRoute is the resource defining how HTTP traffic should be routed by a Mesh or Gateway resource.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/global/httpRoutes/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_services_http_route.default
