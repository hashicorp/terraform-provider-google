```tf
import {
  identity = {
    name = "<-required value->"
    location = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_network_security_sac_attachment.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SacAttachment using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/sacAttachments/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_security_sac_attachment.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), SacAttachment can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_security_sac_attachment.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/sacAttachments/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_security_sac_attachment.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_security_sac_attachment.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
