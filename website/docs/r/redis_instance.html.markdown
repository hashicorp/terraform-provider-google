# google\_redis\_instance

A Google Cloud Redis instance.

To get more information about Instance, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/reference/rest/)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/)

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage
```hcl
resource "google_redis_instance" "test" {
  name           = "%s"
  memory_size_gb = 1
}
```

### Full Usage
```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "test" {
  name = "%s"
}

resource "google_redis_instance" "test" {
  name           = "%s"
  tier           = "STANDARD_HA"
  memory_size_gb = 1

  region                  = "us-central1"
  location_id             = "us-central1-a"
  alternative_location_id = "us-central1-f"

  redis_version     = "REDIS_3_2"
  display_name      = "Terraform Test Instance"
  reserved_ip_range = "192.168.0.0/29"

  labels {
    my_key    = "my_val"
    other_key = "other_val"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the instance or a fully qualified identifier for the instance.
* `memory_size_gb` -
  (Required)
  Redis memory size in GiB.


- - -

* `alternative_location_id` -
  (Optional)
  Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
  against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones.
  If provided, it must be a different zone from the one provided in
  [locationId].
* `authorized_network` -
  (Optional)
  The full name of the Google Compute Engine network to which the
  instance is connected. If left unspecified, the default network
  will be used.
* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  An arbitrary and optional user-provided name for the instance.
* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Resource labels to represent user provided metadata.
* `location_id` -
  (Optional)
  The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided,
  the service will choose a zone for the instance. For STANDARD_HA tier,
  instances will be created across two zones for protection against
  zonal failures. If [alternativeLocationId] is also provided, it must
  be different from [locationId].
* `redis_version` -
  (Optional)
  The version of Redis software. If not provided, latest supported
  version will be used. Updating the version will perform an
  upgrade/downgrade to the new version. Currently, the supported values
  are REDIS_3_2 for Redis 3.2.
* `reserved_ip_range` -
  (Optional)
  The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this
  instance. If not provided, the service will choose an unused /29
  block, for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29. Ranges must be
  unique and non-overlapping with existing subnets in an authorized
  network.
* `tier` -
  (Optional)
  The service tier of the instance. Must be one of these values:

  - BASIC: standalone instance
  - STANDARD_HA: highly available primary/replica instances
* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the Redis region of the instance.
* `project` (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `create_time` -
  The time the instance was created in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format,
  accurate to nanoseconds.
* `current_location_id` -
  The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed.
  For Basic Tier instances, this will always be the same as the
  [locationId] provided by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier
  instances, this can be either [locationId] or [alternativeLocationId]
  and can change after a failover event.
* `host` -
  Hostname or IP address of the exposed Redis endpoint used by clients
  to connect to the service.
* `port` -
  The port number of the exposed Redis endpoint.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 6 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_redis_instance.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/instances/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_redis_instance.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_redis_instance.default {{name}}
```
