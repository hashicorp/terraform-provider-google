A trace scope is a collection of resources whose traces are queried together

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](../guides/provider_versions.html.markdown) for more details on beta resources.


## Example Usage - Observability Trace Scope Basic


```hcl
resource "google_observability_trace_scope" "observability_trace_scope" {
    depends_on       = [google_project.project-2]
    provider         = google-beta
    trace_scope_id   = "test-scope"
    location         = "global"
    resource_names   = [
        "projects/${data.google_project.project.project_id}",
        "projects/${google_project.project-2.project_id}",
    ]
    description      = "A trace scope configured with Terraform"
}

data "google_project" "project" {
    provider         = google-beta
}

resource "google_project" "project-2" {
    provider         = google-beta
    project_id       = "tf-test%{random_suffix}"
    name             = "tf-test%{random_suffix}"
    org_id           = "123456789"
    deletion_policy  = "DELETE"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `resource_names` -
  (Required)
  Names of the projects that are included in this trace scope.
  *  `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`
  A trace scope can include a maximum of 20 projects.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  GCP region the TraceScope is stored in. Only `global` is supported.

* `trace_scope_id` -
  (Required)
  A client-assigned identifier for the trace scope.


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Describes this trace scope.
  The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/traceScopes/{{trace_scope_id}}`

* `create_time` -
  The creation timestamp of the trace scope.

* `name` -
  Identifier. The resource name of the trace scope.
  For example:
  projects/my-project/locations/global/traceScopes/my-trace-scope

* `update_time` -
  The last update timestamp of the trace scope.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


TraceScope can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/traceScopes/{{trace_scope_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{trace_scope_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{trace_scope_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import TraceScope using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/traceScopes/{{trace_scope_id}}"
  to = google_observability_trace_scope.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), TraceScope can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_observability_trace_scope.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/traceScopes/{{trace_scope_id}}
$ terraform import google_observability_trace_scope.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{trace_scope_id}}
$ terraform import google_observability_trace_scope.default {{location}}/{{trace_scope_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
