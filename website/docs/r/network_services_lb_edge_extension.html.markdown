## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `forwarding_rules` -
  (Required)
  A list of references to the forwarding rules to which this service extension is attached.
  At least one forwarding rule is required. Only one LbEdgeExtension resource can be associated with a forwarding rule.

* `extension_chains` -
  (Required)
  A set of ordered extension chains that contain the match conditions and extensions to execute.
  Match conditions for each extension chain are evaluated in sequence for a given request.
  The first extension chain that has a condition that matches the request is executed.
  Any subsequent extension chains do not execute. Limited to 5 extension chains per resource.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_extension_chains).

* `load_balancing_scheme` -
  (Required)
  All forwarding rules referenced by this extension must share the same load balancing scheme.
  Possible values are: `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the edge extension

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the LbEdgeExtension resource in the following format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/lbEdgeExtensions/{lbEdgeExtensions}


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A human-readable description of the resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Set of labels associated with the LbEdgeExtension resource.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_extension_chains"></a>The `extension_chains` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name for this extension chain. The name is logged as part of the HTTP request logs.
  The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens,
  and can have a maximum length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a letter
  and the last character must be a letter or a number.

* `match_condition` -
  (Required)
  Conditions under which this chain is invoked for a request.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_extension_chains_match_condition).

* `extensions` -
  (Required)
  A set of extensions to execute for the matching request.
  At least one extension is required. Up to 3 extensions can be defined for each extension chain for
  LbTrafficExtension resource. LbRouteExtension chains are limited to 1 extension per extension chain.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_extension_chains_extensions).


<a name="nested_extension_chains_match_condition"></a>The `match_condition` block supports:

* `cel_expression` -
  (Required)
  A Common Expression Language (CEL) expression that is used to match requests for which the extension chain is executed.

<a name="nested_extension_chains_extensions"></a>The `extensions` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the HTTP request logs.
  The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens,
  and can have a maximum length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a letter
  and the last a letter or a number.

* `service` -
  (Required)
  The reference to the service that runs the extension.
  * To configure a callout extension, service must be a fully-qualified reference to a backend service.
  * To configure a plugin extension, service must be a reference to a WasmPlugin resource.

* `fail_open` -
  (Optional)
  Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or times out.
  When set to TRUE, request or response processing continues without error.
  Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also executed.
  When set to FALSE: * If response headers have not been delivered to the downstream client,
  a generic 500 error is returned to the client. The error response can be tailored by
  configuring a custom error response in the load balancer.

* `supported_events` -
  (Optional)
  A set of events during request or response processing for which this extension is called.
  This field is required for the LbEdgeExtension resource and only supports the value `REQUEST_HEADERS`.

* `forward_headers` -
  (Optional)
  List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or backend).
  If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string indicating the header name.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbEdgeExtensions/{{name}}`

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


LbEdgeExtension can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbEdgeExtensions/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import LbEdgeExtension using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbEdgeExtensions/{{name}}"
  to = google_network_services_lb_edge_extension.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), LbEdgeExtension can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_network_services_lb_edge_extension.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/lbEdgeExtensions/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_services_lb_edge_extension.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_network_services_lb_edge_extension.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
