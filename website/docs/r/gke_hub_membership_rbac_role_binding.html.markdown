```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  provider = google-beta
  name               = "basic-cluster"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 1
  deletion_protection  = "true"
  network       = "default"
  subnetwork    = "default"
}

resource "google_gke_hub_membership" "membership" {
  provider = google-beta
  membership_id = "tf-test-membership%{random_suffix}"
  endpoint {
    gke_cluster {
      resource_link = "//container.googleapis.com/${google_container_cluster.primary.id}"
    }
  }

  depends_on = [google_container_cluster.primary]
}

  membership_rbac_role_binding_id = "tf-test-membership-rbac-role-binding%{random_suffix}"
  membership_id = google_gke_hub_membership.membership.membership_id
  user = "service-${data.google_project.project.number}@gcp-sa-anthossupport.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  role {
    predefined_role = "ANTHOS_SUPPORT"
  }
  location = "global"
  depends_on = [google_gke_hub_membership.membership]
}

## Import


MembershipRBACRoleBinding can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/rbacrolebindings/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MembershipRBACRoleBinding using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/rbacrolebindings/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}"
  to = google_gke_hub_membership_rbac_role_binding.default

```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), MembershipRBACRoleBinding can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_gke_hub_membership_rbac_role_binding.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/memberships/{{membership_id}}/rbacrolebindings/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}
$ terraform import google_gke_hub_membership_rbac_role_binding.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{membership_id}}/{{membership_rbac_role_binding_id}}
