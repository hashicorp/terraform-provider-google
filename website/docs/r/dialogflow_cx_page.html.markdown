A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  The human-readable name of the page, unique within the agent.


- - -


* `entry_fulfillment` -
  (Optional)
  The fulfillment to call when the session is entering the page.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_entry_fulfillment).

* `form` -
  (Optional)
  The form associated with the page, used for collecting parameters relevant to the page.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_form).

* `transition_route_groups` -
  (Optional)
  Ordered list of TransitionRouteGroups associated with the page. Transition route groups must be unique within a page.
  If multiple transition routes within a page scope refer to the same intent, then the precedence order is: page's transition route -> page's transition route group -> flow's transition routes.
  If multiple transition route groups within a page contain the same intent, then the first group in the ordered list takes precedence.
  Format:projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/flows/<Flow ID>/transitionRouteGroups/<TransitionRouteGroup ID>.

* `transition_routes` -
  (Optional)
  A list of transitions for the transition rules of this page. They route the conversation to another page in the same flow, or another flow.
  When we are in a certain page, the TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:
  TransitionRoutes defined in the page with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the transition route groups with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in flow with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the transition route groups with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the page with only condition specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the transition route groups with only condition specified.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_transition_routes).

* `event_handlers` -
  (Optional)
  Handlers associated with the page to handle events such as webhook errors, no match or no input.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_event_handlers).

* `parent` -
  (Optional)
  The flow to create a page for.
  Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/flows/<Flow ID>.

* `language_code` -
  (Optional)
  The language of the following fields in page:
  Page.entry_fulfillment.messages
  Page.entry_fulfillment.conditional_cases
  Page.event_handlers.trigger_fulfillment.messages
  Page.event_handlers.trigger_fulfillment.conditional_cases
  Page.form.parameters.fill_behavior.initial_prompt_fulfillment.messages
  Page.form.parameters.fill_behavior.initial_prompt_fulfillment.conditional_cases
  Page.form.parameters.fill_behavior.reprompt_event_handlers.messages
  Page.form.parameters.fill_behavior.reprompt_event_handlers.conditional_cases
  Page.transition_routes.trigger_fulfillment.messages
  Page.transition_routes.trigger_fulfillment.conditional_cases
  If not specified, the agent's default language is used. Many languages are supported. Note: languages must be enabled in the agent before they can be used.

Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

  The human-readable name of the parameter, unique within the form.

* `required` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates whether the parameter is required. Optional parameters will not trigger prompts; however, they are filled if the user specifies them.
  Required parameters must be filled before form filling concludes.

* `entity_type` -
  (Optional)
  The entity type of the parameter.
  Format: projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/<System Entity Type ID> for system entity types (for example, projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/sys.date), or projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/entityTypes/<Entity Type ID> for developer entity types.

  (Optional)
  Indicates whether the parameter represents a list of values.

* `fill_behavior` -
  (Optional)
