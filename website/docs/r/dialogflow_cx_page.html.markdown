  TransitionRoutes defined in the page with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the transition route groups with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in flow with intent specified.
  TransitionRoutes defined in the transition route groups with intent specified.

  The webhook to call. Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/webhooks/<Webhook ID>.

* `return_partial_responses` -
  (Optional)
  Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

* `tag` -
  (Optional)
  The tag used by the webhook to identify which fulfillment is being called. This field is required if webhook is specified.

* `set_parameter_actions` -
  (Optional)
  Set parameter values before executing the webhook.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_set_parameter_actions).

* `conditional_cases` -
  (Optional)
  Conditional cases for this fulfillment.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conditional_cases).


<a name="nested_messages"></a>The `messages` block supports:

* `channel` -
  (Optional)
  The channel which the response is associated with. Clients can specify the channel via QueryParameters.channel, and only associated channel response will be returned.

* `text` -
  (Optional)
  The text response message.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_text).

* `payload` -
  (Optional)
  A custom, platform-specific payload.

* `conversation_success` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
  You may set this, for example:
  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
  * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conversation_success).

* `output_audio_text` -

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_output_audio_text).

* `live_agent_handoff` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
  You may set this, for example:
  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
  * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_live_agent_handoff).

* `play_audio` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies an audio clip to be played by the client as part of the response.

* `cases` -
  (Optional)
  A JSON encoded list of cascading if-else conditions. Cases are mutually exclusive. The first one with a matching condition is selected, all the rest ignored.
  See [Case](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/Fulfillment#case) for the schema.

<a name="nested_form"></a>The `form` block supports:

  Indicates whether the parameter is required. Optional parameters will not trigger prompts; however, they are filled if the user specifies them.
  Required parameters must be filled before form filling concludes.

* `entity_type` -
  (Optional)
  The entity type of the parameter.
  Format: projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/<System Entity Type ID> for system entity types (for example, projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/sys.date), or projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/entityTypes/<Entity Type ID> for developer entity types.

* `is_list` -

  Indicates whether the parameter content should be redacted in log.
  If redaction is enabled, the parameter content will be replaced by parameter name during logging. Note: the parameter content is subject to redaction if either parameter level redaction or entity type level redaction is enabled.


<a name="nested_fill_behavior"></a>The `fill_behavior` block supports:

* `initial_prompt_fulfillment` -
  (Optional)
  The fulfillment to provide the initial prompt that the agent can present to the user in order to fill the parameter.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_initial_prompt_fulfillment).

* `reprompt_event_handlers` -
  (Optional)
  The handlers for parameter-level events, used to provide reprompt for the parameter or transition to a different page/flow. The supported events are:
  * sys.no-match-<N>, where N can be from 1 to 6
  * sys.no-match-default
  * sys.no-input-<N>, where N can be from 1 to 6
  * sys.no-input-default
  * sys.invalid-parameter
  [initialPromptFulfillment][initialPromptFulfillment] provides the first prompt for the parameter.
  If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment associated with the sys.no-match-1/sys.no-input-1 handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The sys.no-match-2/sys.no-input-2 handler (if defined) will respond to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on.
  A sys.no-match-default or sys.no-input-default handler will be used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed.
  A sys.invalid-parameter handler can be defined to handle the case where the parameter values have been invalidated by webhook. For example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated with the sys.invalid-parameter handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt.
  If the event handler for the corresponding event can't be found on the parameter, initialPromptFulfillment will be re-prompted.

Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

* `tag` -

  (Optional)
  A custom, platform-specific payload.

* `conversation_success` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about.
  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
  You may set this, for example:
  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
  * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conversation_success).

* `output_audio_text` -

* `live_agent_handoff` -
  (Optional)
  Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
  Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
  You may set this, for example:
  * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
  * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_live_agent_handoff).
