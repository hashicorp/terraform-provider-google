# google\_monitoring\_alert\_policy

A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is
considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people or services
about this state.


To get more information about AlertPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.alertPolicies)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/)

## Example Usage - Monitoring Alert Policy Basic


```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "alert_policy" {
  display_name = "My Alert Policy"
  combiner     = "OR"
  conditions {
    display_name = "test condition"
    condition_threshold {
      filter     = "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/write_bytes_count\" AND resource.type=\"gce_instance\""
      duration   = "60s"
      comparison = "COMPARISON_GT"
      aggregations {
        alignment_period   = "60s"
        per_series_aligner = "ALIGN_RATE"
      }
    }
  }

  user_labels = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in
  dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use
  the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The
  name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.

* `combiner` -
  (Required)
  How to combine the results of multiple conditions to
  determine if an incident should be opened.

* `conditions` -
  (Required)
  A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by
  AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined conditions
  evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from
  one to six conditions.  Structure is documented below.


The `conditions` block supports:

* `condition_absent` -
  (Optional)
  A condition that checks that a time series
  continues to receive new data points.  Structure is documented below.

* `name` -
  The unique resource name for this condition.
  Its syntax is:
  projects/[PROJECT_ID]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID]/conditions/[CONDITION_ID]
  [CONDITION_ID] is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when
  the condition is created as part of a new or updated alerting
  policy.

* `condition_threshold` -
  (Optional)
  A condition that compares a time series against a
  threshold.  Structure is documented below.

* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  A short name or phrase used to identify the
  condition in dashboards, notifications, and
  incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same
  display name for multiple conditions in the same
  policy.


The `condition_absent` block supports:

* `aggregations` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the alignment of data points in
  individual time series as well as how to
  combine the retrieved time series together
  (such as when aggregating multiple streams
  on each resource to a single stream for each
  resource or when aggregating streams across
  all members of a group of resources).
  Multiple aggregations are applied in the
  order specified.  Structure is documented below.

* `trigger` -
  (Optional)
  The number/percent of time series for which
  the comparison must hold in order for the
  condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
  the condition will trigger if the comparison
  is true for any of the time series that have
  been identified by filter and aggregations.  Structure is documented below.

* `duration` -
  (Required)
  The amount of time that a time series must
  fail to report new data to be considered
  failing. Currently, only values that are a
  multiple of a minute--e.g. 60s, 120s, or 300s
  --are supported.

* `filter` -
  (Optional)
  A filter that identifies which time series
  should be compared with the threshold.The
  filter is similar to the one that is
  specified in the
  MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
  call is useful to verify the time series
  that will be retrieved / processed) and must
  specify the metric type and optionally may
  contain restrictions on resource type,
  resource labels, and metric labels. This
  field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
  in length.


The `aggregations` block supports:

* `per_series_aligner` -
  (Optional)
  The approach to be used to align
  individual time series. Not all
  alignment functions may be applied
  to all time series, depending on
  the metric type and value type of
  the original time series.
  Alignment may change the metric
  type or the value type of the time
  series.Time series data must be
  aligned in order to perform cross-
  time series reduction. If
  crossSeriesReducer is specified,
  then perSeriesAligner must be
  specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
  and alignmentPeriod must be
  specified; otherwise, an error is
  returned.

* `group_by_fields` -
  (Optional)
  The set of fields to preserve when
  crossSeriesReducer is specified.
  The groupByFields determine how
  the time series are partitioned
  into subsets prior to applying the
  aggregation function. Each subset
  contains time series that have the
  same value for each of the
  grouping fields. Each individual
  time series is a member of exactly
  one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
  is applied to each subset of time
  series. It is not possible to
  reduce across different resource
  types, so this field implicitly
  contains resource.type. Fields not
  specified in groupByFields are
  aggregated away. If groupByFields
  is not specified and all the time
  series have the same resource
  type, then the time series are
  aggregated into a single output
  time series. If crossSeriesReducer
  is not defined, this field is
  ignored.

* `alignment_period` -
  (Optional)
  The alignment period for per-time
  series alignment. If present,
  alignmentPeriod must be at least
  60 seconds. After per-time series
  alignment, each time series will
  contain data points only on the
  period boundaries. If
  perSeriesAligner is not specified
  or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this
  field is ignored. If
  perSeriesAligner is specified and
  does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then
  this field must be defined;
  otherwise an error is returned.

* `cross_series_reducer` -
  (Optional)
  The approach to be used to combine
  time series. Not all reducer
  functions may be applied to all
  time series, depending on the
  metric type and the value type of
  the original time series.
  Reduction may change the metric
  type of value type of the time
  series.Time series data must be
  aligned in order to perform cross-
  time series reduction. If
  crossSeriesReducer is specified,
  then perSeriesAligner must be
  specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
  and alignmentPeriod must be
  specified; otherwise, an error is
  returned.

The `trigger` block supports:

* `percent` -
  (Optional)
  The percentage of time series that
  must fail the predicate for the
  condition to be triggered.

* `count` -
  (Optional)
  The absolute number of time series
  that must fail the predicate for the
  condition to be triggered.

The `condition_threshold` block supports:

* `threshold_value` -
  (Optional)
  A value against which to compare the time
  series.

* `denominator_filter` -
  (Optional)
  A filter that identifies a time series that
  should be used as the denominator of a ratio
  that will be compared with the threshold. If
  a denominator_filter is specified, the time
  series specified by the filter field will be
  used as the numerator.The filter is similar
  to the one that is specified in the
  MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
  call is useful to verify the time series
  that will be retrieved / processed) and must
  specify the metric type and optionally may
  contain restrictions on resource type,
  resource labels, and metric labels. This
  field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
  in length.

* `denominator_aggregations` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the alignment of data points in
  individual time series selected by
  denominatorFilter as well as how to combine
  the retrieved time series together (such as
  when aggregating multiple streams on each
  resource to a single stream for each
  resource or when aggregating streams across
  all members of a group of resources).When
  computing ratios, the aggregations and
  denominator_aggregations fields must use the
  same alignment period and produce time
  series that have the same periodicity and
  labels.This field is similar to the one in
  the MetricService.ListTimeSeries request. It
  is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries
  method when debugging this field.  Structure is documented below.

* `duration` -
  (Required)
  The amount of time that a time series must
  violate the threshold to be considered
  failing. Currently, only values that are a
  multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or
  300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid
  value is given, an error will be returned.
  When choosing a duration, it is useful to
  keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
  time series data (which may also be affected
  by any alignments specified in the
  aggregations field); a good duration is long
  enough so that a single outlier does not
  generate spurious alerts, but short enough
  that unhealthy states are detected and
  alerted on quickly.

* `comparison` -
  (Required)
  The comparison to apply between the time
  series (indicated by filter and aggregation)
  and the threshold (indicated by
  threshold_value). The comparison is applied
  on each time series, with the time series on
  the left-hand side and the threshold on the
  right-hand side. Only COMPARISON_LT and
  COMPARISON_GT are supported currently.

* `trigger` -
  (Optional)
  The number/percent of time series for which
  the comparison must hold in order for the
  condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
  the condition will trigger if the comparison
  is true for any of the time series that have
  been identified by filter and aggregations,
  or by the ratio, if denominator_filter and
  denominator_aggregations are specified.  Structure is documented below.

* `aggregations` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the alignment of data points in
  individual time series as well as how to
  combine the retrieved time series together
  (such as when aggregating multiple streams
  on each resource to a single stream for each
  resource or when aggregating streams across
  all members of a group of resources).
  Multiple aggregations are applied in the
  order specified.This field is similar to the
  one in the MetricService.ListTimeSeries
  request. It is advisable to use the
  ListTimeSeries method when debugging this
  field.  Structure is documented below.

* `filter` -
  (Optional)
  A filter that identifies which time series
  should be compared with the threshold.The
  filter is similar to the one that is
  specified in the
  MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
  call is useful to verify the time series
  that will be retrieved / processed) and must
  specify the metric type and optionally may
  contain restrictions on resource type,
  resource labels, and metric labels. This
  field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
  in length.
