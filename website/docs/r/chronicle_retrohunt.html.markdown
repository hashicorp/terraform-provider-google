Retrohunt is an execution of a Rule over a time range in the past.


To get more information about Retrohunt, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances.rules.retrohunts)
* How-to Guides
    * [Google SecOps Guides](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/secops/secops-overview)

## Example Usage - Chronicle Retrohunt Basic


```hcl
resource "google_chronicle_rule" "my-rule" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 deletion_policy = "FORCE"
 text = <<-EOT
             rule test_rule { meta: events:  $userid = $e.principal.user.userid  match: $userid over 10m condition: $e }
         EOT
}

resource "google_chronicle_retrohunt" "example" {
 location = "us"
 instance = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
 rule = element(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name), length(split("/", resource.google_chronicle_rule.my-rule.name)) - 1)
 process_interval {
    start_time = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    end_time = "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
 }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `process_interval` -
  (Required)
  Represents a time interval, encoded as a Timestamp start (inclusive) and a
  Timestamp end (exclusive).
  The start must be less than or equal to the end.
  When the start equals the end, the interval is empty (matches no time).
  When both start and end are unspecified, the interval matches any time.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_process_interval).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the resource. This is the geographical region where the Chronicle instance resides, such as "us" or "europe-west2".

* `instance` -
  (Required)
  The unique identifier for the Chronicle instance, which is the same as the customer ID.

* `rule` -
  (Required)
  The Rule ID of the rule.


* `retrohunt` -
  (Optional)
  The retrohunt ID of the Retrohunt. A retrohunt is an execution of a Rule over a time range in the past.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



<a name="nested_process_interval"></a>The `process_interval` block supports:

* `start_time` -
  (Required)
  Inclusive start of the interval.

* `end_time` -
  (Required)
  Exclusive end of the interval.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/retrohunts/{{retrohunt}}`

* `progress_percentage` -
  Output only. Percent progress of the retrohunt towards completion, from 0.00 to 100.00.

* `name` -
  The resource name of the retrohunt.
  Retrohunt is the child of a rule revision. {rule} in the format below is
  structured as {rule_id@revision_id}.
  Format:
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}/retrohunts/{retrohunt}

* `execution_interval` -
  Represents a time interval, encoded as a Timestamp start (inclusive) and a
  Timestamp end (exclusive).
  The start must be less than or equal to the end.
  When the start equals the end, the interval is empty (matches no time).
  When both start and end are unspecified, the interval matches any time.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_execution_interval).

* `state` -
  Output only. The state of the retrohunt.
  Possible values:
  RUNNING
  DONE
  CANCELLED
  FAILED


<a name="nested_execution_interval"></a>The `execution_interval` block contains:

* `end_time` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Exclusive end of the interval.
  If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be before the
  end.

* `start_time` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Inclusive start of the interval.
  If specified, a Timestamp matching this interval will have to be the same
  or after the start.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


Retrohunt can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/retrohunts/{{retrohunt}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}/{{retrohunt}}`
* `{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}/{{retrohunt}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Retrohunt using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    location = "<-required value->"
    instance = "<-required value->"
    rule = "<-required value->"
    retrohunt = "<-optional value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_chronicle_retrohunt.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Retrohunt using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/retrohunts/{{retrohunt}}"
  to = google_chronicle_retrohunt.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Retrohunt can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_chronicle_retrohunt.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance}}/rules/{{rule}}/retrohunts/{{retrohunt}}
$ terraform import google_chronicle_retrohunt.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}/{{retrohunt}}
$ terraform import google_chronicle_retrohunt.default {{location}}/{{instance}}/{{rule}}/{{retrohunt}}
```
