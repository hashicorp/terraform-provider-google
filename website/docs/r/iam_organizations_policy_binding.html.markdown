A policy binding to an organizations

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about OrganizationsPolicyBinding, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v3beta/organizations.locations.policyBindings)
* How-to Guides
    * [Apply a policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-create#create_binding)

## Example Usage - Iam Organizations Policy Binding


```hcl
resource "google_iam_principal_access_boundary_policy" "pab_policy" {
  provider = google-beta
  organization   = "123456789"
  location       = "global"
  display_name   = "test org binding"
  principal_access_boundary_policy_id = "my-pab-policy"
}

resource "google_iam_organizations_policy_binding" "my-org-binding" {
  provider = google-beta
  organization   = "123456789"
  location       = "global"
  display_name   = "test org binding"
  policy_kind    = "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY"
  policy_binding_id = "test-org-binding"
  policy         = "organizations/123456789/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/${google_iam_principal_access_boundary_policy.pab_policy.principal_access_boundary_policy_id}"
  target {
    principal_set = "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/123456789"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `target` -
  (Required)
  Target is the full resource name of the resource to which the policy will be bound. Immutable once set.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_target).

* `policy` -
  (Required)
  Required. Immutable. The resource name of the policy to be bound. The binding parent and policy must belong to the same Organization (or Project).

* `organization` -
  (Required)
  The parent organization of the Policy Binding.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the Policy Binding

* `policy_binding_id` -
  (Required)
  The Policy Binding ID.


<a name="nested_target"></a>The `target` block supports:

* `principal_set` -
  (Optional)
  Required. Immutable. The resource name of the policy to be bound.
  The binding parent and policy must belong to the same Organization (or Project).

- - -


* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. The description of the policy binding. Must be less than or equal to 63 characters.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. User defined annotations. See https://google.aip.dev/148#annotations for more details such as format and size limitations

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_annotations` for all of the annotations present on the resource.

* `policy_kind` -
  (Optional)
  Immutable. The kind of the policy to attach in this binding. This
  field must be one of the following:  - Left empty (will be automatically set
  to the policy kind) - The input policy kind   Possible values:  POLICY_KIND_UNSPECIFIED PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY ACCESS

* `condition` -
  (Optional)
  Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language
  (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of
  CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.
  Example (Comparison):
  title: \"Summary size limit\"
  description: \"Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars\"
  expression: \"document.summary.size() < 100\"
  Example
  (Equality):
  title: \"Requestor is owner\"
  description: \"Determines if requestor is the document owner\"
  expression: \"document.owner == request.auth.claims.email\"  Example
  (Logic):
  title: \"Public documents\"
  description: \"Determine whether the document should be publicly visible\"
  expression: \"document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'\"
  Example (Data Manipulation):
  title: \"Notification string\"
  description: \"Create a notification string with a timestamp.\"
  expression: \"'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)\"
  The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are
  determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for
  additional information.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_condition).


<a name="nested_condition"></a>The `condition` block supports:

* `expression` -
  (Optional)
  Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.

* `title` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}`

* `name` -
  The name of the policy binding in the format `{binding_parent/locations/{location}/policyBindings/{policy_binding_id}`

* `uid` -
  Output only. The globally unique ID of the policy binding. Assigned when the policy binding is created.

* `etag` -
  Optional. The etag for the policy binding. If this is provided on update, it must match the server's etag.

* `policy_uid` -
  Output only. The globally unique ID of the policy to be bound.

* `create_time` -
  Output only. The time when the policy binding was created.

* `update_time` -
  Output only. The time when the policy binding was most recently updated.

* `effective_annotations` -
  All of annotations (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

## Import


OrganizationsPolicyBinding can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}`
* `{{organization}}/{{location}}/{{policy_binding_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import OrganizationsPolicyBinding using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}"
  to = google_iam_organizations_policy_binding.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), OrganizationsPolicyBinding can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_iam_organizations_policy_binding.default organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/policyBindings/{{policy_binding_id}}
$ terraform import google_iam_organizations_policy_binding.default {{organization}}/{{location}}/{{policy_binding_id}}
```
