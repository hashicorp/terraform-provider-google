# google_access_context_manager_access_policy

AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary
attributes to use GCP services) and ServicePerimeters (which define
regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.


To get more information about AccessPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies)
* How-to Guides
    * [Access Policy Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/quickstart)

~> **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
`billing_project` you defined.
