# google\_access\_context\_manager\_access\_policy

AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary
attributes to use GCP services) and ServicePerimeters (which define
regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.
