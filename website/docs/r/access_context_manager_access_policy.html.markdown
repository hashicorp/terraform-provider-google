# google_access_context_manager_access_policy

AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary
attributes to use GCP services) and ServicePerimeters (which define
regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.


To get more information about AccessPolicy, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies)
* How-to Guides
    * [Access Policy Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/quickstart)

~> **Warning:** If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
`billing_project` you defined.

## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Access Policy Basic


```hcl
resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "access-policy" {
  parent = "organizations/123456789"
  title  = "Org Access Policy"
}
```
## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Access Policy Scoped


```hcl
resource "google_project" "project" {
  project_id      = "my-project-name"
  name            = "my-project-name"
  org_id          = "123456789"
  deletion_policy = "DELETE"
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "access-policy" {
  parent = "organizations/123456789"
  title  = "Scoped Access Policy"
  scopes = ["projects/${google_project.project.number}"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `parent` -
  (Required)
  The parent of this AccessPolicy in the Cloud Resource Hierarchy.
  Format: 'organizations/{{organization_id}}'

* `title` -
  (Required)
  Human readable title. Does not affect behavior.


* `scopes` -
  (Optional)
  Folder or project on which this policy is applicable.
  Format: 'folders/{{folder_id}}' or 'projects/{{project_number}}'

* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the resource. Defaults to DELETE.
	When a 'terraform destroy' or 'terraform apply' would delete the resource,
	the command will fail if this field is set to "PREVENT" in Terraform state.
	When set to "ABANDON", the command will remove the resource from Terraform
	management without updating or deleting the resource in the API.
	When set to "DELETE", deleting the resource is allowed.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{name}}`

* `name` -
  Resource name of the AccessPolicy. Format: '{{policy_id}}'

* `create_time` -
  Time the AccessPolicy was created in UTC.

* `update_time` -
  Time the AccessPolicy was updated in UTC.
