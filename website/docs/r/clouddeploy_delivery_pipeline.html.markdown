  The Cloud Deploy `DeliveryPipeline` resource
---

# google_clouddeploy_delivery_pipeline

The Cloud Deploy `DeliveryPipeline` resource

## Example Usage - delivery_pipeline
Creates a basic Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline
```hcl
resource "google_clouddeploy_delivery_pipeline" "primary" {
  location = "us-west1"
  name     = "pipeline"

  annotations = {
    my_first_annotation = "example-annotation-1"

    my_second_annotation = "example-annotation-2"
  }

  description = "basic description"

  labels = {
    my_first_label = "example-label-1"

    my_second_label = "example-label-2"
  }

  project = "my-project-name"

  serial_pipeline {
    stages {
      profiles  = ["example-profile-one", "example-profile-two"]
      target_id = "example-target-one"
    }

    stages {
      profiles  = []
      target_id = "example-target-two"
    }
  }
}


```
## Example Usage - verify_delivery_pipeline
tests creating and updating a delivery pipeline with deployment verification strategy
```hcl
resource "google_clouddeploy_delivery_pipeline" "primary" {
  location = "us-west1"
  name     = "pipeline"

  annotations = {
    my_first_annotation = "example-annotation-1"

    my_second_annotation = "example-annotation-2"
  }

  description = "basic description"

  labels = {
    my_first_label = "example-label-1"

    my_second_label = "example-label-2"
  }

  project = "my-project-name"

  serial_pipeline {
    stages {
      profiles  = ["example-profile-one", "example-profile-two"]
      target_id = "example-target-one"
    }

    stages {
      profiles  = []
      target_id = "example-target-two"
    }
  }
  provider = google-beta
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the resource
  
* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the `DeliveryPipeline`. Format is [a-z][a-z0-9\-]{0,62}.
  


- - -

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used by the user, and not by Google Cloud Deploy. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations for more details such as format and size limitations.
  
* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Description of the `DeliveryPipeline`. Max length is 255 characters.
  
* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Google Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels. Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be <= 128 bytes.
  
* `project` -
  (Optional)
  The project for the resource
  
* `serial_pipeline` -
  (Optional)
  SerialPipeline defines a sequential set of stages for a `DeliveryPipeline`.
  
* `suspended` -
  (Optional)
  When suspended, no new releases or rollouts can be created, but in-progress ones will complete.
  


The `serial_pipeline` block supports:
    
* `stages` -
  (Optional)
  Each stage specifies configuration for a `Target`. The ordering of this list defines the promotion flow.
    
The `stages` block supports:
    
* `profiles` -
  (Optional)
  Skaffold profiles to use when rendering the manifest for this stage's `Target`.
    
* `strategy` -
  (Optional)
  (Beta only) Optional. The strategy to use for a `Rollout` to this stage.
    
* `target_id` -
  (Optional)
  The target_id to which this stage points. This field refers exclusively to the last segment of a target name. For example, this field would just be `my-target` (rather than `projects/project/locations/location/targets/my-target`). The location of the `Target` is inferred to be the same as the location of the `DeliveryPipeline` that contains this `Stage`.
    
The `strategy` block supports:
    
* `standard` -
  (Optional)
  Standard deployment strategy executes a single deploy and allows verifying the deployment.
    
The `standard` block supports:
    
* `verify` -
  (Optional)
  Whether to verify a deployment.
    
## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/deliveryPipelines/{{name}}`

* `condition` -
  Output only. Information around the state of the Delivery Pipeline.
  
* `create_time` -
  Output only. Time at which the pipeline was created.
  
* `etag` -
  This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  
* `uid` -
  Output only. Unique identifier of the `DeliveryPipeline`.
  
* `update_time` -
  Output only. Most recent time at which the pipeline was updated.
