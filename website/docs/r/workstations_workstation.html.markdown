* `workstation_id` -
  (Required)
  ID to use for the workstation.

* `workstation_config_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the workstation cluster config.

* `workstation_cluster_id` -
  (Required)
  The name of the workstation cluster.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location where the workstation cluster config should reside.


- - -


* `display_name` -
  (Optional)
  Human-readable name for this resource.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}`

* `name` -
  The name of the cluster resource.

* `uid` -
  The system-generated UID of the resource.

* `create_time` -
  Time the Instance was created in UTC.

* `host` -
  Host to which clients can send HTTPS traffic that will be received by the workstation. 
  Authorized traffic will be received to the workstation as HTTP on port 80. 
  To send traffic to a different port, clients may prefix the host with the destination port in the format "{port}-{host}".

* `state` -
  Current state of the workstation.
