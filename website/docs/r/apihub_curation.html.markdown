  project = "apihub-terraform"
  display_name = "Test Curation"
  description = "This is a sample curation resource managed by Terraform."
  endpoint {
    application_integration_endpoint_details {
      trigger_id = "api_trigger/curation_API_1"
      uri = "https://integrations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/1082615593856/locations/us-central1/integrations/curation:execute"

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/curations/{{curation_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{curation_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{curation_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Curation using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/curations/{{curation_id}}"
  to = google_apihub_curation.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Curation can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apihub_curation.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/curations/{{curation_id}}
$ terraform import google_apihub_curation.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{curation_id}}
$ terraform import google_apihub_curation.default {{location}}/{{curation_id}}
```
