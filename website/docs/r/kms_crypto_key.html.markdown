# google\_kms\_crypto\_key

A `CryptoKey` represents a logical key that can be used for cryptographic operations.


~> **Note:** CryptoKeys cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
Destroying a Terraform-managed CryptoKey will remove it from state
and delete all CryptoKeyVersions, rendering the key unusable, but *will
not delete the resource on the server.* When Terraform destroys these keys,
any data previously encrypted with these keys will be irrecoverable.
For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you add lifecycle hooks
to the resource to prevent accidental destruction.


To get more information about CryptoKey, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys)
* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys#create_a_key)

## Example Usage - Kms Crypto Key Basic


```hcl
resource "google_kms_key_ring" "keyring" {
  name     = "keyring-example"
  location = "global"
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "example-key" {
  name            = "crypto-key-example"
  key_ring        = google_kms_key_ring.keyring.self_link
  rotation_period = "100000s"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Kms Crypto Key Asymmetric Sign


```hcl
resource "google_kms_key_ring" "keyring" {
  name     = "keyring-example"
  location = "global"
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "example-asymmetric-sign-key" {
  name     = "crypto-key-example"
  key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.keyring.self_link
  purpose  = "ASYMMETRIC_SIGN"

  version_template {
    algorithm = "EC_SIGN_P384_SHA384"
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The resource name for the CryptoKey.

* `key_ring` -
  (Required)
  The KeyRing that this key belongs to.
  Format: `'projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/keyRings/{{keyRing}}'`.


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels with user-defined metadata to apply to this resource.

* `purpose` -
  (Optional)
  The immutable purpose of this CryptoKey. See the
  [purpose reference](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys#CryptoKeyPurpose)
  for possible inputs.

* `rotation_period` -
  (Optional)
  Every time this period passes, generate a new CryptoKeyVersion and set it as the primary.
  The first rotation will take place after the specified period. The rotation period has
  the format of a decimal number with up to 9 fractional digits, followed by the
  letter `s` (seconds). It must be greater than a day (ie, 86400).

* `version_template` -
  (Optional)
  A template describing settings for new crypto key versions.  Structure is documented below.


The `version_template` block supports:

* `algorithm` -
  (Required)
  The algorithm to use when creating a version based on this template.
  See the [algorithm reference](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/CryptoKeyVersionAlgorithm) for possible inputs.

* `protection_level` -
  (Optional)
  The protection level to use when creating a version based on this template.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:



* `self_link`: The self link of the created CryptoKey. Its format is `{{key_ring}}/cryptoKeys/{{name}}`.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

CryptoKey can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_kms_crypto_key.default {{key_ring}}/cryptoKeys/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_kms_crypto_key.default {{key_ring}}/{{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
