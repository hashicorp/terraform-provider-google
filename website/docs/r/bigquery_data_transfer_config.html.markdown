# google\_bigquery\_data\_transfer\_config

Represents a data transfer configuration. A transfer configuration
contains all metadata needed to perform a data transfer.


To get more information about Config, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/)

## Example Usage - Scheduled Query


```hcl
data "google_project" "project" {
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "permissions" {
  role   = "roles/iam.serviceAccountShortTermTokenMinter"
  member = "serviceAccount:service-${data.google_project.project.number}@gcp-sa-bigquerydatatransfer.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}

resource "google_bigquery_data_transfer_config" "query_config" {
  depends_on = [google_project_iam_member.permissions]

  display_name           = "my-query"
  location               = "asia-northeast1"
  data_source_id         = "scheduled_query"
  schedule               = "first sunday of quarter 00:00"
  destination_dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.my_dataset.dataset_id
  params = {
    destination_table_name_template = "my-table"
    write_disposition               = "WRITE_APPEND"
    query                           = "SELECT name FROM tabl WHERE x = 'y'"
  }
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "my_dataset" {
  depends_on = [google_project_iam_member.permissions]

  dataset_id    = "my_dataset"
  friendly_name = "foo"
  description   = "bar"
  location      = "asia-northeast1"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `display_name` -
  (Required)
  The user specified display name for the transfer config.

* `destination_dataset_id` -
  (Required)
  The BigQuery target dataset id.

* `data_source_id` -
  (Required)
  The data source id. Cannot be changed once the transfer config is created.

* `params` -
  (Required)
  These parameters are specific to each data source.


- - -


* `schedule` -
  (Optional)
  Data transfer schedule. If the data source does not support a custom
  schedule, this should be empty. If it is empty, the default value for
  the data source will be used. The specified times are in UTC. Examples
  of valid format: 1st,3rd monday of month 15:30, every wed,fri of jan,
  jun 13:15, and first sunday of quarter 00:00. See more explanation
  about the format here:
  https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml#the_schedule_format
  NOTE: the granularity should be at least 8 hours, or less frequent.

* `data_refresh_window_days` -
  (Optional)
  The number of days to look back to automatically refresh the data.
  For example, if dataRefreshWindowDays = 10, then every day BigQuery
  reingests data for [today-10, today-1], rather than ingesting data for
  just [today-1]. Only valid if the data source supports the feature.
  Set the value to 0 to use the default value.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  When set to true, no runs are scheduled for a given transfer.

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
  Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `name` -
  The resource name of the transfer config. Transfer config names have the
  form projects/{projectId}/locations/{location}/transferConfigs/{configId}.
  Where configId is usually a uuid, but this is not required.
  The name is ignored when creating a transfer config.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Config can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_bigquery_data_transfer_config.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
