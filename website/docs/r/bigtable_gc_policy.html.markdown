[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/go/reference).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_bigtable_instance" "instance" {
  name = "tf-instance"
  cluster {
    cluster_id   = "tf-instance-cluster"
    zone         = "us-central1-b"
    num_nodes    = 3
    storage_type = "HDD"
  }
}

resource "google_bigtable_table" "table" {
  name          = "tf-table"
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.instance.name

  column_family {
    family = "name"
  }
}

resource "google_bigtable_gc_policy" "policy" {
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.instance.name
  table         = google_bigtable_table.table.name
  column_family = "name"

  max_age {
    days = 7
  }
}
```

Multiple conditions is also supported. `UNION` when any of its sub-policies apply (OR). `INTERSECTION` when all its sub-policies apply (AND)
```hcl
resource "google_bigtable_gc_policy" "policy" {
  instance_name = google_bigtable_instance.instance.name
  table         = google_bigtable_table.table.name
  column_family = "name"

  mode = "UNION"

  max_age {
    days = 7
  }

  max_version {
    number = 10
  }
}
```
