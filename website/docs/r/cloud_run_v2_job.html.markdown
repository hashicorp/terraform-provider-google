## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the Job.

* `template` -
  (Required)
  The template used to create executions for this Job.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_template).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location of the cloud run job


<a name="nested_template"></a>The `template` block supports:

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter,
  or break down billing charges by team, component, environment, state, etc. For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels or
  https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected.
  All system labels in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 ExecutionTemplate.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected.
  All system annotations in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 ExecutionTemplate.
  This field follows Kubernetes annotations' namespacing, limits, and rules.

* `parallelism` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the maximum desired number of tasks the execution should run at given time. Must be <= taskCount. When the job is run, if this field is 0 or unset, the maximum possible value will be used for that execution. The actual number of tasks running in steady state will be less than this number when there are fewer tasks waiting to be completed remaining, i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism.

* `task_count` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the desired number of tasks the execution should run. Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that task signals the success of the execution. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/

* `template` -
  (Required)
  Describes the task(s) that will be created when executing an execution
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_template).

  (Optional)
  A list of Volumes to make available to containers.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_volumes).

* `timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Max allowed time duration the Task may be active before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. This applies per attempt of a task, meaning each retry can run for the full timeout.
  A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: "3.5s".

* `service_account` -
  (Optional)
  Email address of the IAM service account associated with the Task of a Job. The service account represents the identity of the running task, and determines what permissions the task has. If not provided, the task will use the project's default service account.

* `execution_environment` -
  (Optional)
  The execution environment being used to host this Task.
  Possible values are: `EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_GEN1`, `EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_GEN2`.

* `encryption_key` -
  (Optional)
  A reference to a customer managed encryption key (CMEK) to use to encrypt this container image. For more information, go to https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek

* `vpc_access` -
  (Optional)
  VPC Access configuration to use for this Task. For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-vpc.

<a name="nested_network_interfaces"></a>The `network_interfaces` block supports:

* `network` -
  (Optional)
  The VPC network that the Cloud Run resource will be able to send traffic to. At least one of network or subnetwork must be specified. If both
  network and subnetwork are specified, the given VPC subnetwork must belong to the given VPC network. If network is not specified, it will be
  looked up from the subnetwork.

* `subnetwork` -
  (Optional)
  The VPC subnetwork that the Cloud Run resource will get IPs from. At least one of network or subnetwork must be specified. If both
  network and subnetwork are specified, the given VPC subnetwork must belong to the given VPC network. If subnetwork is not specified, the
  subnetwork with the same name with the network will be used.

* `tags` -
  (Optional)
  Network tags applied to this Cloud Run job.

- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter, or break down billing charges by team, component,
  environment, state, etc. For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels or https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected.
  All system labels in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 Job.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `annotations` -
  (Optional)
  Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
  Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with `run.googleapis.com`, `cloud.googleapis.com`, `serving.knative.dev`, or `autoscaling.knative.dev` namespaces, and they will be rejected on new resources.
  All system annotations in v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 Job.
  This field follows Kubernetes annotations' namespacing, limits, and rules.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_annotations` for all of the annotations present on the resource.

* `client` -
  (Optional)
  Arbitrary identifier for the API client.

* `client_version` -
  (Optional)
  Arbitrary version identifier for the API client.

* `launch_stage` -
  (Optional)
  The launch stage as defined by [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Cloud Run supports ALPHA, BETA, and GA.
  If no value is specified, GA is assumed. Set the launch stage to a preview stage on input to allow use of preview features in that stage. On read (or output), describes whether the resource uses preview features.
  For example, if ALPHA is provided as input, but only BETA and GA-level features are used, this field will be BETA on output.
  Possible values are: `UNIMPLEMENTED`, `PRELAUNCH`, `EARLY_ACCESS`, `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `GA`, `DEPRECATED`.

* `binary_authorization` -
  (Optional)
  Settings for the Binary Authorization feature.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_binary_authorization).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_binary_authorization"></a>The `binary_authorization` block supports:

* `breakglass_justification` -
  (Optional)
  If present, indicates to use Breakglass using this justification. If useDefault is False, then it must be empty. For more information on breakglass, see https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/using-breakglass

* `use_default` -
  (Optional)
  If True, indicates to use the default project's binary authorization policy. If False, binary authorization will be disabled.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/jobs/{{name}}`

* `uid` -
  Server assigned unique identifier for the Execution. The value is a UUID4 string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until the resource is deleted.

* `generation` -
  A number that monotonically increases every time the user modifies the desired state.

* `create_time` -
  The creation time.

* `update_time` -
  The last-modified time.

* `delete_time` -
  The deletion time.

* `expire_time` -
  For a deleted resource, the time after which it will be permamently deleted.

* `creator` -
  Email address of the authenticated creator.

* `last_modifier` -
  Email address of the last authenticated modifier.

* `observed_generation` -
  The generation of this Job. See comments in reconciling for additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.

* `terminal_condition` -
  The Condition of this Job, containing its readiness status, and detailed error information in case it did not reach the desired state
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_terminal_condition).

* `conditions` -
  The Conditions of all other associated sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics information in case the Job does not reach its desired state. See comments in reconciling for additional information on `reconciliation` process in Cloud Run.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_conditions).

* `execution_count` -
  Number of executions created for this job.

* `latest_created_execution` -
  Name of the last created execution.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_latest_created_execution).

* `reconciling` -
  Returns true if the Job is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.
  When a new Job is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Job to the desired state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution, will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the state matches the Job, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state.
  If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: observedGeneration and generation, latest_succeeded_execution and latestCreatedExecution.
  If reconciliation failed, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution will have the state of the last succeeded execution or empty for newly created Job. Additional information on the failure can be found in terminalCondition and conditions

* `etag` -
  A system-generated fingerprint for this version of the resource. May be used to detect modification conflict during updates.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

* `effective_annotations` -
  All of annotations (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, other clients and services.
