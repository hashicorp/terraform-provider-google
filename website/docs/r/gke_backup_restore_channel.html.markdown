# google_gke_backup_restore_channel

A RestoreChannel imposes constraints on where backups can be restored.
The RestoreChannel should be in the same project and region
as the backups. The backups can only be restored in the
destination_project.


To get more information about RestoreChannel, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/backup-for-gke/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.restoreChannels)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/add-on/backup-for-gke)

## Example Usage - Gkebackup Restorechannel Basic


```hcl
resource "google_gke_backup_restore_channel" "basic" {
  name = "basic-channel"
  location = "us-central1"
  description = "Description"
  destination_project = "projects/24240755850"
  labels = { "key": "some-value" }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  The full name of the RestoreChannel Resource.

* `destination_project` -
  (Required)
  The project where Backups will be restored.
  The format is `projects/{project}`.
  {project} can be project number or project id.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The region of the Restore Channel.


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  User specified descriptive string for this RestoreChannel.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Description: A set of custom labels supplied by the user.
  A list of key->value pairs.
  Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/restoreChannels/{{name}}`

* `uid` -
  Server generated, unique identifier of UUID format.

* `etag` -
  etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
  updates of a restore channel from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
  systems make use of the 'etag' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform RestoreChannel updates
  in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to restoreChannels.get,
  and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to restoreChannels.patch or
  restoreChannels.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.

* `destination_project_id` -
  The project_id where Backups will be restored.
  Example Project ID: "my-project-id".

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource
   and default labels configured on the provider.

* `effective_labels` -
  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 5 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 5 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 5 minutes.

## Import


RestoreChannel can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/restoreChannels/{{name}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}`
* `{{location}}/{{name}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import RestoreChannel using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    name = "<-required value->"
    location = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_gke_backup_restore_channel.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RestoreChannel using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/restoreChannels/{{name}}"
  to = google_gke_backup_restore_channel.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), RestoreChannel can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_gke_backup_restore_channel.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/restoreChannels/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_gke_backup_restore_channel.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_gke_backup_restore_channel.default {{location}}/{{name}}
```
