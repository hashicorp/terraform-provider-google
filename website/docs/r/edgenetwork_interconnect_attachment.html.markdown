## Example Usage - Edgenetwork Interconnect Attachment


```hcl

resource "google_edgenetwork_interconnect_attachment" "example_interconnect_attachment" {
  interconnect_attachment_id   = "example-interconnect-attachment"
  location     = "us-west1"
  zone         = ""
  description  = "Example interconnect attachment."
  network      = google_edgenetwork_network.example_network.id
  interconnect = "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
  vlan_id      = 55
  mtu          = 9000
  labels       = {
    "environment" : "dev"
  }
}

resource "google_edgenetwork_network" "example_network" {
  network_id  = "example-network"
  location    = "us-west1"
  zone        = ""
  description = "Example network."
  mtu         = 9000
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `interconnect` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the underlying interconnect that this attachment's traffic will traverse through.

* `network` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the network to which this interconnect attachment belongs.
  Must be of the form: `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/zones/{{zone}}/networks/{{network_id}}`

* `vlan_id` -
  (Required)
  VLAN ID provided by user. Must be site-wise unique.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The Google Cloud region to which the target Distributed Cloud Edge zone belongs.

* `zone` -
  (Required)
  The name of the target Distributed Cloud Edge zone.

* `interconnect_attachment_id` -
  (Required)
  A unique ID that identifies this interconnect attachment.


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels associated with this resource.

  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
