# google_backup_dr_backup_plan

A backup plan defines when and how to back up a resource, including the backup's schedule, retention, and location.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about BackupPlan, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/reference/rest)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs)

## Example Usage - Backup Dr Backup Plan Simple


```hcl
resource "google_backup_dr_backup_vault" "my_backup_vault" {
  provider                                      = google-beta
  location                                      = "us-central1"
  backup_vault_id                               = "backup-vault-simple-test"
  backup_minimum_enforced_retention_duration    = "100000s"
}

resource "google_backup_dr_backup_plan" "my-backup-plan-1" {
  provider       = google-beta
  location       = "us-central1"
  backup_plan_id = "backup-plan-simple-test"
  resource_type  = "compute.googleapis.com/Instance"
  backup_vault   = google_backup_dr_backup_vault.my_backup_vault.id

  backup_rules {
    rule_id                = "rule-1"
    backup_retention_days  = 5

    standard_schedule {
      recurrence_type     = "HOURLY"
      hourly_frequency    = 6
      time_zone           = "UTC"

      backup_window {
        start_hour_of_day = 0
        end_hour_of_day   = 24
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* `backup_vault` -
  (Required)
  Backup vault where the backups gets stored using this Backup plan.

  (Required)
  The backup rules for this `BackupPlan`. There must be at least one `BackupRule` message.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_backup_rules).

* `location` -
  (Required)
  The location for the backup plan

* `backup_plan_id` -
  (Required)
  The ID of the backup plan


<a name="nested_backup_rules"></a>The `backup_rules` block supports:

* `rule_id` -
  (Required)
  The unique ID of this `BackupRule`. The `rule_id` is unique per `BackupPlan`.

* `backup_retention_days` -
  (Required)
  Configures the duration for which backup data will be kept. The value should be greater than or equal to minimum enforced retention of the backup vault.

* `standard_schedule` -
  (Required)
  StandardSchedule defines a schedule that runs within the confines of a defined window of days.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_standard_schedule).


<a name="nested_standard_schedule"></a>The `standard_schedule` block supports:

* `recurrence_type` -
  (Required)
  RecurrenceType enumerates the applicable periodicity for the schedule.
  Possible values are: `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`.

* `hourly_frequency` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies frequency for hourly backups. An hourly frequency of 2 means jobs will run every 2 hours from start time till end time defined.
  This is required for `recurrence_type`, `HOURLY` and is not applicable otherwise.

* `days_of_week` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies days of week like MONDAY or TUESDAY, on which jobs will run. This is required for `recurrence_type`, `WEEKLY` and is not applicable otherwise.
  Each value may be one of: `DAY_OF_WEEK_UNSPECIFIED`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`.

* `days_of_month` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies days of months like 1, 5, or 14 on which jobs will run.

* `week_day_of_month` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a week day of the month like FIRST SUNDAY or LAST MONDAY, on which jobs will run.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_week_day_of_month).

  Each value may be one of: `MONTH_UNSPECIFIED`, `JANUARY`, `FEBRUARY`, `MARCH`, `APRIL`, `MAY`, `JUNE`, `JULY`, `AUGUST`, `SEPTEMBER`, `OCTOBER`, `NOVEMBER`, `DECEMBER`.

* `time_zone` -
  (Required)
  The time zone to be used when interpreting the schedule.

* `backup_window` -
  (Optional)
  A BackupWindow defines the window of the day during which backup jobs will run. Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked as
  `NOT_RUN` if they do not start by the end of the window.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_backup_window).


<a name="nested_week_day_of_month"></a>The `week_day_of_month` block supports:

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 60 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 60 minutes.

## Import


BackupPlan can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import BackupPlan using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}"
  to = google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), BackupPlan can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default {{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
