A backup plan defines when and how to back up a resource, including the backup's schedule, retention, and location.


To get more information about BackupPlan, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/reference/rest)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs)

## Example Usage - Backup Dr Backup Plan Simple


```hcl
resource "google_backup_dr_backup_vault" "my_backup_vault" {
  location                                      = "us-central1"
  backup_vault_id                               = "backup-vault-simple-test"
  backup_minimum_enforced_retention_duration    = "100000s"
}

resource "google_backup_dr_backup_plan" "my-backup-plan-1" {
  location       = "us-central1"
  backup_plan_id = "backup-plan-simple-test"
  resource_type  = "compute.googleapis.com/Instance"
  backup_vault   = google_backup_dr_backup_vault.my_backup_vault.id
  max_custom_on_demand_retention_days = 30

  backup_rules {
    rule_id                = "rule-1"
    backup_retention_days  = 5

    standard_schedule {
      recurrence_type     = "HOURLY"
      hourly_frequency    = 6
      time_zone           = "UTC"

## Import


BackupPlan can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import BackupPlan using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}"
  to = google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), BackupPlan can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backupPlans/{{backup_plan_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
$ terraform import google_backup_dr_backup_plan.default {{location}}/{{backup_plan_id}}
```
