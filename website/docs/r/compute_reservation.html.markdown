# google\_compute\_reservation

Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is
held in a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.

Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
`g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
services not listed above
like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.


To get more information about Reservation, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations)
* How-to Guides
    * [Reserving zonal resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)

## Example Usage - Reservation Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_reservation" "gce_reservation" {
  name = "gce-reservation"
  zone = "us-central1-a"

  specific_reservation {
    count = 1
    instance_properties {
      min_cpu_platform = "Intel Cascade Lake"
      machine_type     = "n2-standard-2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `specific_reservation` -
  (Required)
  Reservation for instances with specific machine shapes.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_specific_reservation).

* `zone` -
  (Required)
  The zone where the reservation is made.


<a name="nested_specific_reservation"></a>The `specific_reservation` block supports:

* `count` -
  (Required)
  The number of resources that are allocated.

* `in_use_count` -
  How many instances are in use.

* `instance_properties` -
  (Required)
  The instance properties for the reservation.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_instance_properties).


<a name="nested_instance_properties"></a>The `instance_properties` block supports:

* `machine_type` -
  (Required)
  The name of the machine type to reserve.

* `min_cpu_platform` -
  (Optional)
  The minimum CPU platform for the reservation. For example,
  `"Intel Skylake"`. See
  the CPU platform availability reference](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform#availablezones)
  for information on available CPU platforms.

* `guest_accelerators` -
  (Optional)
  Guest accelerator type and count.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_guest_accelerators).

* `local_ssds` -
  (Optional)
  The amount of local ssd to reserve with each instance. This
  reserves disks of type `local-ssd`.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_local_ssds).


<a name="nested_guest_accelerators"></a>The `guest_accelerators` block supports:

* `accelerator_type` -
  (Required)
  The full or partial URL of the accelerator type to
  attach to this instance. For example:
  `projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-c/acceleratorTypes/nvidia-tesla-p100`
  If you are creating an instance template, specify only the accelerator name.

* `accelerator_count` -
  (Required)
  The number of the guest accelerator cards exposed to
  this instance.

<a name="nested_local_ssds"></a>The `local_ssds` block supports:

* `interface` -
  (Optional)
  The disk interface to use for attaching this disk.
  Default value is `SCSI`.
  Possible values are `SCSI` and `NVME`.

* `disk_size_gb` -
  (Required)
  The size of the disk in base-2 GB.

- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `specific_reservation_required` -
  (Optional)
  When set to true, only VMs that target this reservation by name can
  consume this reservation. Otherwise, it can be consumed by VMs with
  affinity for any reservation. Defaults to false.

* `share_settings` -
  (Optional)
  The share setting for reservations.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_share_settings).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


<a name="nested_share_settings"></a>The `share_settings` block supports:

* `share_type` -
  (Optional)
  Type of sharing for this shared-reservation
  Possible values are `LOCAL` and `SPECIFIC_PROJECTS`.

* `project_map` -
  (Optional)
  A map of project number and project config. This is only valid when shareType's value is SPECIFIC_PROJECTS.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_project_map).


<a name="nested_project_map"></a>The `project_map` block supports:

* `id` - (Required) The identifier for this object. Format specified above.

* `project_id` -
  (Optional)
  The project id/number, should be same as the key of this project config in the project map.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/reservations/{{name}}`

* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `commitment` -
  Full or partial URL to a parent commitment. This field displays for
  reservations that are tied to a commitment.

* `status` -
  The status of the reservation.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.
