# google\_compute\_reservation

Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is
held in a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.

Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
`g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
services not listed above
like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.


To get more information about Reservation, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations)
* How-to Guides
    * [Reserving zonal resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)

## Example Usage - Reservation Basic


```hcl
resource "google_compute_reservation" "gce_reservation" {
  name = "gce-reservation"
  zone = "us-central1-a"

  specific_reservation {
    count = 1
    instance_properties {
      min_cpu_platform = "Intel Cascade Lake"
      machine_type     = "n2-standard-2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.

* `specific_reservation` -
  (Required)
  Reservation for instances with specific machine shapes.  Structure is documented below.

* `zone` -
  (Required)
  The zone where the reservation is made.


The `specific_reservation` block supports:

* `count` -
  (Required)
  The number of resources that are allocated.

* `in_use_count` -
  How many instances are in use.

* `instance_properties` -
  (Required)
  The instance properties for the reservation.  Structure is documented below.


The `instance_properties` block supports:

* `machine_type` -
  (Required)
  The name of the machine type to reserve.

* `min_cpu_platform` -
  (Optional)
  The minimum CPU platform for the reservation. For example,
  `"Intel Skylake"`. See
  the CPU platform availability reference](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform#availablezones)
  for information on available CPU platforms.

* `guest_accelerators` -
  (Optional)
  Guest accelerator type and count.  Structure is documented below.

* `local_ssds` -
  (Optional)
  The amount of local ssd to reserve with each instance. This
  reserves disks of type `local-ssd`.  Structure is documented below.


The `guest_accelerators` block supports:

* `accelerator_type` -
  (Required)
  The full or partial URL of the accelerator type to
  attach to this instance. For example:
  `projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-c/acceleratorTypes/nvidia-tesla-p100`
  If you are creating an instance template, specify only the accelerator name.

* `accelerator_count` -
  (Required)
  The number of the guest accelerator cards exposed to
  this instance.

The `local_ssds` block supports:

* `interface` -
  (Optional)
  The disk interface to use for attaching this disk, one
  of `SCSI` or `NVME`. The default is `SCSI`.

* `disk_size_gb` -
  (Required)
  The size of the disk in base-2 GB.

- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `specific_reservation_required` -
  (Optional)
  When set to true, only VMs that target this reservation by name can
  consume this reservation. Otherwise, it can be consumed by VMs with
  affinity for any reservation. Defaults to false.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `commitment` -
  Full or partial URL to a parent commitment. This field displays for
  reservations that are tied to a commitment.

* `status` -
  The status of the reservation.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_reservation.default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/reservations/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_reservation.default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_reservation.default {{zone}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_reservation.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_reference.html#user_project_override).
