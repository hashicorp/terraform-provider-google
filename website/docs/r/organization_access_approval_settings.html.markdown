resource "google_organization_access_approval_settings" "organization_access_approval" {
  organization_id     = "123456789"
  notification_emails = ["testuser@example.com", "example.user@example.com"]

  enrolled_services {
  	cloud_product = "appengine.googleapis.com"
  }

  enrolled_services {
  	cloud_product = "dataflow.googleapis.com"
  	enrollment_level = "BLOCK_ALL"
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Organization Access Approval Active Key Version


```hcl
resource "google_project" "my_project" {
  name       = "My Project"
  project_id = "your-project-id"
  org_id     = "123456789"
}

resource "google_kms_key_ring" "key_ring" {
  name     = "key-ring"
  location = "global"
  project  = google_project.my_project.project_id
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key" "crypto_key" {
  name = "crypto-key"
  key_ring = google_kms_key_ring.key_ring.id
  purpose = "ASYMMETRIC_SIGN"

  version_template {
    algorithm = "EC_SIGN_P384_SHA384"
  }
}

data "google_access_approval_organization_service_account" "service_account" {

  role          = "roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier"
  member        = "serviceAccount:${data.google_access_approval_organization_service_account.service_account.account_email}"
}

data "google_kms_crypto_key_version" "crypto_key_version" {
  crypto_key = google_kms_crypto_key.crypto_key.id
}

resource "google_organization_access_approval_settings" "organization_access_approval" {
  organization_id     = "123456789"
  active_key_version  = data.google_kms_crypto_key_version.crypto_key_version.name

  enrolled_services {
  	cloud_product = "all"
