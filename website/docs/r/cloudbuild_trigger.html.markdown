  (Optional)
  Human-readable description of the trigger.

* `tags` -
  (Optional)
  Tags for annotation of a BuildTrigger

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether the trigger is disabled or not. If true, the trigger will never result in a build.

* `substitutions` -
  (Optional)
  Substitutions data for Build resource.

* `filename` -
  (Optional)
  Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template. Either a filename or build template must be provided.

  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
  used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
  If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
  of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
  of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.

  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
  should trigger the build.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
  those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
  a build.

  There can be at most 100 secret values across all of a build's secrets.

The `step` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the container image that will run this particular build step.
  If the image is available in the host's Docker daemon's cache, it will be
  run directly. If not, the host will attempt to pull the image first, using
  the builder service account's credentials if necessary.
  The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all of
  the officially supported build steps (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders 
  for images and examples).
  The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
  images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
  you attempt to use them.

  host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
  later build step.

  (Optional)
  A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
  If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
  are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
  entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
  remainder will be used as arguments.

* `env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
  running a step.
  The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
  "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".

* `id` -
  (Optional)
  Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to
  reference this build step as a dependency.

* `entrypoint` -
  (Optional)
  Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
  default entrypoint.
  If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used

* `dir` -
  (Optional)
  Working directory to use when running this step's container.
  If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
  directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
  directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
  across build step executions, unless a `volume` for that path is specified.
  If the build specifies a `RepoSource` with `dir` and a step with a
  `dir`,
  which specifies an absolute path, the `RepoSource` `dir` is ignored
  for the step's execution.

* `secret_env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
  a Cloud Key
  Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
  the build's `Secret`.

  completes or the build itself times out.

* `timing` -
  (Optional)
  Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
  build step.

* `volumes` -
  (Optional)
  List of volumes to mount into the build step.
  Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
  build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
  are discarded.
  Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
  indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
  Structure is documented below.

* `wait_for` -
  (Optional)
  The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
  This build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for`
  have completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step
  will start when all previous build steps in the `Build.Steps` list
  have completed successfully.


The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the volume to mount.
  Volume names must be unique per build step and must be valid names for
  Docker volumes. Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

* `path` -
  (Required)
  Path at which to mount the volume.
  Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
  the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

The `artifacts` block supports:

* `images` -
  (Optional)
  A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
  The images will be pushed using the builder service account's credentials.

  If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.

* `objects` -
  (Optional)
  A list of objects to be uploaded to Cloud Storage upon successful completion of all build steps.
  Files in the workspace matching specified paths globs will be uploaded to the
  Cloud Storage location using the builder service account's credentials.

  If any objects fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
  Structure is documented below.


The `objects` block supports:

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  Cloud Storage bucket and optional object path, in the form "gs://bucket/path/to/somewhere/".
  Files in the workspace matching any path pattern will be uploaded to Cloud Storage with
  this location as a prefix.

* `paths` -
  (Optional)
  Path globs used to match files in the build's workspace.

* `timing` -
  Output only. Stores timing information for pushing all artifact objects.
  Structure is documented below.


The `timing` block contains:

* `start_time` -
  (Optional)
  Start of time span.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to

* `end_time` -
  (Optional)
  End of time span.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to
  nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

The `options` block supports:

* `disk_size_gb` -
  (Optional)
  Requested disk size for the VM that runs the build. Note that this is NOT "disk free";
  some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities.
  Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build --
  the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size
  is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error.

* `substitution_option` -
  (Optional)
  Option to specify behavior when there is an error in the substitution checks.
  NOTE this is always set to ALLOW_LOOSE for triggered builds and cannot be overridden
  in the build configuration file.

* `secret_env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of global environment variables, which are encrypted using a Cloud Key Management
  Service crypto key. These values must be specified in the build's Secret. These variables
  will be available to all build steps in this build.

* `volumes` -
  (Optional)
  Global list of volumes to mount for ALL build steps
  Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to starting the build process.
  Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Global
  volume names and paths cannot conflict with the volumes defined a build step.
  Using a global volume in a build with only one step is not valid as it is indicative
  of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
  Structure is documented below.


The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
