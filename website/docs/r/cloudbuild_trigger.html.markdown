## Example Usage - Cloudbuild Trigger Filename


```hcl
resource "google_cloudbuild_trigger" "filename-trigger" {
  trigger_template {
    branch_name = "master"
    repo_name   = "my-repo"
  }

  substitutions = {
    _FOO = "bar"
    _BAZ = "qux"
  }

  filename = "cloudbuild.yaml"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:



- - -


* `name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  Human-readable description of the trigger.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Whether the trigger is disabled or not. If true, the trigger will never result in a build.

* `substitutions` -
  (Optional)
  Substitutions data for Build resource.

* `filename` -
  (Optional)
  Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template. Either a filename or build template must be provided.

* `ignored_files` -
  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using http://godoc/pkg/path/filepath#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
  used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
  If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
  of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
  of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.

* `included_files` -
  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using http://godoc/pkg/path/filepath#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
  should trigger the build.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
  those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
  a build.

* `trigger_template` -
  (Optional)
  Template describing the types of source changes to trigger a build.
  Branch and tag names in trigger templates are interpreted as regular
  expressions. Any branch or tag change that matches that regular
  expression will trigger a build.
  One of `trigger_template` or `github` must be provided.  Structure is documented below.

* `build` -
  (Optional)
  Contents of the build template. Either a filename or build template must be provided.  Structure is documented below.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `trigger_template` block supports:

* `project_id` -
  (Optional)
  ID of the project that owns the Cloud Source Repository. If
  omitted, the project ID requesting the build is assumed.

* `repo_name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the Cloud Source Repository. If omitted, the name "default" is assumed.

* `dir` -
  (Optional)
  Directory, relative to the source root, in which to run the build.
  This must be a relative path. If a step's dir is specified and
  is an absolute path, this value is ignored for that step's
  execution.

* `branch_name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the branch to build. Exactly one a of branch name, tag, or commit SHA must be provided.
  This field is a regular expression.

* `tag_name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the tag to build. Exactly one of a branch name, tag, or commit SHA must be provided.
  This field is a regular expression.

* `commit_sha` -
  (Optional)
  Explicit commit SHA to build. Exactly one of a branch name, tag, or commit SHA must be provided.

The `build` block supports:

* `tags` -
  (Optional)
  Tags for annotation of a Build. These are not docker tags.

* `images` -
  (Optional)
  A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
  The images are pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
  The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
  If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build status is marked FAILURE.

* `timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity. 
  If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be TIMEOUT.
  This timeout must be equal to or greater than the sum of the timeouts for build steps within the build.
  The expected format is the number of seconds followed by s.
  Default time is ten minutes (600s).

* `step` -
  (Required)
  The operations to be performed on the workspace.  Structure is documented below.


The `step` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  The name of the container image that will run this particular build step.
  If the image is available in the host's Docker daemon's cache, it will be
  run directly. If not, the host will attempt to pull the image first, using
  the builder service account's credentials if necessary.
  The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all of
  the officially supported build steps (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders).
  The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
  images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
  you attempt to use them.
  If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in the
  host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
  later build step.

* `args` -
  (Optional)
  A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
  If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
  are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
  entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
  remainder will be used as arguments.

* `env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
  running a step.
  The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
  "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".

* `id` -
  (Optional)
  Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to
  reference this build step as a dependency.

* `entrypoint` -
  (Optional)
  Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
  default entrypoint.
  If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used

* `dir` -
  (Optional)
  Working directory to use when running this step's container.
  If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
  directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
  directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
  across build step executions, unless a `volume` for that path is specified.
  If the build specifies a `RepoSource` with `dir` and a step with a
  `dir`,
  which specifies an absolute path, the `RepoSource` `dir` is ignored
  for the step's execution.

* `secret_env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
  a Cloud Key
  Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
  the build's `Secret`.

* `timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined,
  the step has no
  time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until either it
  completes or the build itself times out.

* `timing` -
  (Optional)
  Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
  build step.

* `volumes` -
  (Optional)
  List of volumes to mount into the build step.
  Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
  build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
  are discarded.
  Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
  indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.  Structure is documented below.

* `wait_for` -
  (Optional)
  The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
  This build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for`
  have completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step
  will start when all previous build steps in the `Build.Steps` list
  have completed successfully.


The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the volume to mount.
  Volume names must be unique per build step and must be valid names for
  Docker volumes. Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

* `path` -
  (Required)
  Path at which to mount the volume.
  Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
  the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `trigger_id` -
