  (Optional)
  Human-readable description of the trigger.

* `tags` -
  (Optional)
  Tags for annotation of a BuildTrigger

* `substitutions` -
  (Optional)
  Substitutions data for Build resource.

* `service_account` -
  (Optional)
  The service account used for all user-controlled operations including
  triggers.patch, triggers.run, builds.create, and builds.cancel.

  result.  Values can be INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_UNSPECIFIED or
  INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_WITH_STATUS
  Possible values are: `INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_UNSPECIFIED`, `INCLUDE_BUILD_LOGS_WITH_STATUS`.

* `filename` -
  (Optional)
  Path, from the source root, to a file whose contents is used for the template.
  Either a filename or build template must be provided. Set this only when using trigger_template or github.
  When using Pub/Sub, Webhook or Manual set the file name using git_file_source instead.

* `filter` -
  (Optional)
  A Common Expression Language string. Used only with Pub/Sub and Webhook.

  Structure is [documented below](#nested_repository_event_config).

* `source_to_build` -
  (Optional)
  The repo and ref of the repository from which to build.
  This field is used only for those triggers that do not respond to SCM events.
  Triggers that respond to such events build source at whatever commit caused the event.

  used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
  If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
  of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
  of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.

* `included_files` -
  (Optional)
  ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
  extended with support for `**`.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
  should trigger the build.
  If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
  and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
  those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
  a build.

* `trigger_template` -

  directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
  directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
  across build step executions, unless a `volume` for that path is specified.
  If the build specifies a `RepoSource` with `dir` and a step with a
  `dir`,
  which specifies an absolute path, the `RepoSource` `dir` is ignored
  for the step's execution.

* `secret_env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
  a Cloud Key
  Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
  the build's `Secret`.

* `timeout` -
  (Optional)
  Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined,
  the step has no
  time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until either it
  completes or the build itself times out.

* `timing` -
  (Optional)
  Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
  build step.

* `volumes` -
  (Optional)
  List of volumes to mount into the build step.
  Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
  build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
  are discarded.
  Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
  indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_volumes).

* `wait_for` -
  (Optional)
  The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
  This build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for`
  have completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step
  will start when all previous build steps in the `Build.Steps` list
  have completed successfully.

* `script` -
  (Optional)
  A shell script to be executed in the step.
  When script is provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.

* `allow_failure` -
  (Optional)
  Allow this build step to fail without failing the entire build.
  If false, the entire build will fail if this step fails. Otherwise, the
  build will succeed, but this step will still have a failure status.
  Error information will be reported in the `failureDetail` field.
  `allowExitCodes` takes precedence over this field.

* `allow_exit_codes` -
  (Optional)
  Allow this build step to fail without failing the entire build if and
  only if the exit code is one of the specified codes.
  If `allowFailure` is also specified, this field will take precedence.


<a name="nested_volumes"></a>The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the volume to mount.
  Volume names must be unique per build step and must be valid names for
  Docker volumes. Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

* `path` -
  (Required)
  Path at which to mount the volume.
  Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
  the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

<a name="nested_artifacts"></a>The `artifacts` block supports:

* `images` -
  (Optional)
  A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
  The images will be pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
  The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
  If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.

* `objects` -
  (Optional)
  A list of objects to be uploaded to Cloud Storage upon successful completion of all build steps.
  Files in the workspace matching specified paths globs will be uploaded to the
  Cloud Storage location using the builder service account's credentials.
  The location and generation of the uploaded objects will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
  If any objects fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_objects).


<a name="nested_objects"></a>The `objects` block supports:

* `location` -
  (Optional)
  Cloud Storage bucket and optional object path, in the form "gs://bucket/path/to/somewhere/".
  Files in the workspace matching any path pattern will be uploaded to Cloud Storage with
  this location as a prefix.

* `paths` -
  (Optional)
  Path globs used to match files in the build's workspace.

* `timing` -
  (Output)
  Output only. Stores timing information for pushing all artifact objects.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_timing).


<a name="nested_timing"></a>The `timing` block contains:

* `start_time` -
  (Optional)
  Start of time span.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to
  nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

* `end_time` -
  (Optional)
  End of time span.
  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to
  nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

<a name="nested_options"></a>The `options` block supports:

* `source_provenance_hash` -
  (Optional)
  Requested hash for SourceProvenance.
  Each value may be one of: `NONE`, `SHA256`, `MD5`.

* `requested_verify_option` -
  (Optional)
  Requested verifiability options.
  Possible values are: `NOT_VERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`.

* `machine_type` -

* `disk_size_gb` -
  (Optional)
  Requested disk size for the VM that runs the build. Note that this is NOT "disk free";
  some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities.
  Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build --
  the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size
  is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error.

* `substitution_option` -
  (Optional)
  Option to specify behavior when there is an error in the substitution checks.
  NOTE this is always set to ALLOW_LOOSE for triggered builds and cannot be overridden
  in the build configuration file.
  Possible values are: `MUST_MATCH`, `ALLOW_LOOSE`.

* `dynamic_substitutions` -
  (Optional)
  Option to specify whether or not to apply bash style string operations to the substitutions.
  NOTE this is always enabled for triggered builds and cannot be overridden in the build configuration file.

* `secret_env` -
  (Optional)
  A list of global environment variables, which are encrypted using a Cloud Key Management
  Service crypto key. These values must be specified in the build's Secret. These variables
  will be available to all build steps in this build.

* `volumes` -
  (Optional)
  Global list of volumes to mount for ALL build steps
  Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to starting the build process.
  Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Global
  volume names and paths cannot conflict with the volumes defined a build step.
  Using a global volume in a build with only one step is not valid as it is indicative
  of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_volumes).


<a name="nested_volumes"></a>The `volumes` block supports:

* `name` -
  (Optional)
  Name of the volume to mount.
