## Using with Instance Group Manager

Instance Templates cannot be updated after creation with the Google
Cloud Platform API. In order to update an Instance Template, Terraform will
destroy the existing resource and create a replacement. In order to effectively
use an Instance Template resource with an [Instance Group Manager resource][1],
it's recommended to specify `create_before_destroy` in a [lifecycle][2] block.
Either omit the Instance Template `name` attribute, or specify a partial name
with `name_prefix`.  Example:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance_template" "instance_template" {
  name_prefix  = "instance-template-"
  machine_type = "e2-medium"
  region       = "us-central1"

  // boot disk
  disk {
    # ...
  }

  // networking
  network_interface {
    # ...
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "google_compute_instance_group_manager" "instance_group_manager" {
  name               = "instance-group-manager"
  instance_template  = google_compute_instance_template.instance_template.id
  base_instance_name = "instance-group-manager"
  zone               = "us-central1-f"
  target_size        = "1"
}
```

With this setup Terraform generates a unique name for your Instance
Template and can then update the Instance Group manager without conflict before
destroying the previous Instance Template.

## Deploying the Latest Image

A common way to use instance templates and managed instance groups is to deploy the
latest image in a family, usually the latest build of your application. There are two
ways to do this in Terraform, and they have their pros and cons. The difference ends
up being in how "latest" is interpreted. You can either deploy the latest image available
when Terraform runs, or you can have each instance check what the latest image is when
it's being created, either as part of a scaling event or being rebuilt by the instance
group manager.

If you're not sure, we recommend deploying the latest image available when Terraform runs,
because this means all the instances in your group will be based on the same image, always,
and means that no upgrades or changes to your instances happen outside of a `terraform apply`.
You can achieve this by using the [`google_compute_image`](../d/compute_image.html)
data source, which will retrieve the latest image on every `terraform apply`, and will update
the template to use that specific image:

```tf
data "google_compute_image" "my_image" {
  family  = "debian-11"
  project = "debian-cloud"
}

resource "google_compute_instance_template" "instance_template" {
  name_prefix  = "instance-template-"
  machine_type = "e2-medium"
  region       = "us-central1"

  // boot disk
  disk {
    source_image = data.google_compute_image.my_image.self_link
  }
}
```

To have instances update to the latest on every scaling event or instance re-creation,
use the family as the image for the disk, and it will use GCP's default behavior, setting
the image for the template to the family:

```tf
resource "google_compute_instance_template" "instance_template" {
  name_prefix  = "instance-template-"
  machine_type = "e2-medium"
  region       = "us-central1"

  // boot disk
  disk {
    source_image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

Note that changing any field for this resource forces a new resource to be created.

The following arguments are supported:

* `disk` - (Required) Disks to attach to instances created from this template.
    This can be specified multiple times for multiple disks. Structure is
    [documented below](#nested_disk).

* `machine_type` - (Required) The machine type to create.

    To create a machine with a [custom type][custom-vm-types] (such as extended memory), format the value like `custom-VCPUS-MEM_IN_MB` like `custom-6-20480` for 6 vCPU and 20GB of RAM.

- - -
* `name` - (Optional) The name of the instance template. If you leave
  this blank, Terraform will auto-generate a unique name.

* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified
  prefix. Conflicts with `name`.

* `can_ip_forward` - (Optional) Whether to allow sending and receiving of
    packets with non-matching source or destination IPs. This defaults to false.

* `description` - (Optional) A brief description of this resource.

* `instance_description` - (Optional) A brief description to use for instances
    created from this template.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs to assign to instances
    created from this template.

    **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
    Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `terraform_labels` -
  The combination of labels configured directly on the resource and default labels configured on the provider.

  All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.

* `metadata` - (Optional) Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
    within instances created from this template.

* `metadata_startup_script` - (Optional) An alternative to using the
    startup-script metadata key, mostly to match the compute_instance resource.
    This replaces the startup-script metadata key on the created instance and
    thus the two mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.

* `network_interface` - (Required) Networks to attach to instances created from
    this template. This can be specified multiple times for multiple networks.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_interface).

* `network_performance_config` (Optional, Configures network performance settings for the instance created from the
    template. Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_performance_config). **Note**: [`machine_type`](#machine_type)
    must be a [supported type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking/configure-vm-with-high-bandwidth-configuration),
    the [`image`](#image) used must include the [`GVNIC`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking/using-gvnic#create-instance-gvnic-image)
    in `guest-os-features`, and `network_interface.0.nic-type` must be `GVNIC`
    in order for this setting to take effect.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `region` - (Optional) An instance template is a global resource that is not
    bound to a zone or a region. However, you can still specify some regional
    resources in an instance template, which restricts the template to the
    region where that resource resides. For example, a custom `subnetwork`
    resource is tied to a specific region. Defaults to the region of the
    Provider if no value is given.

* `resource_policies` (Optional) -- A list of self_links of resource policies to attach to the instance. Modifying this list will cause the instance to recreate. Currently a max of 1 resource policy is supported.

* `reservation_affinity` - (Optional) Specifies the reservations that this instance can consume from.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_reservation_affinity).

* `scheduling` - (Optional) The scheduling strategy to use. More details about
    this configuration option are [detailed below](#nested_scheduling).

* `service_account` - (Optional) Service account to attach to the instance. Structure is [documented below](#nested_service_account).

Shielded VM provides verifiable integrity to prevent against malware and rootkits. Defaults to disabled. Structure is [documented below](#nested_shielded_instance_config).
	**Note**: [`shielded_instance_config`](#shielded_instance_config) can only be used with boot images with shielded vm support. See the complete list [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#shielded-images).

* `enable_display` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) Enable [Virtual Displays](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-instance-virtual-display#verify_display_driver) on this instance.
**Note**: [`allow_stopping_for_update`](#allow_stopping_for_update) must be set to true in order to update this field.

* `confidential_instance_config` (Optional) - Enable [Confidential Mode](https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm) on this VM. Structure is [documented below](#nested_confidential_instance_config)

    to the name of the instance.

* `source_image` - (Optional) The image from which to
    initialize this disk. This can be one of: the image's `self_link`,
    `projects/{project}/global/images/{image}`,
    `projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}`, `global/images/{image}`,
    `global/images/family/{family}`, `family/{family}`, `{project}/{family}`,
    `{project}/{image}`, `{family}`, or `{image}`.
~> **Note:** Either `source`, `source_image`, or `source_snapshot` is **required** in a disk block unless the disk type is `local-ssd`. Check the API [docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceTemplates/insert) for details.

* `source_image_encryption_key` - (Optional) The customer-supplied encryption
    key of the source image. Required if the source image is protected by a
    customer-supplied encryption key.

    Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you
    cannot create disks for instances in a managed instance group if the source
    images are encrypted with your own keys. Structure
    [documented below](#nested_source_image_encryption_key).

* `source_snapshot` - (Optional) The source snapshot to create this disk.
~> **Note:** Either `source`, `source_image`, or `source_snapshot` is **required** in a disk block unless the disk type is `local-ssd`. Check the API [docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceTemplates/insert) for details.

* `source_snapshot_encryption_key` - (Optional) The customer-supplied encryption
    key of the source snapshot. Structure
    [documented below](#nested_source_snapshot_encryption_key).

* `interface` - (Optional) Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
    which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI
    and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format
    than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI.

* `mode` - (Optional) The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE
    or READ_ONLY. If you are attaching or creating a boot disk, this must
    read-write mode.

* `source` - (Optional) The name (**not self_link**)
    of the disk (such as those managed by `google_compute_disk`) to attach.
~> **Note:** Either `source`, `source_image`, or `source_snapshot` is **required** in a disk block unless the disk type is `local-ssd`. Check the API [docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instanceTemplates/insert) for details.

* `disk_type` - (Optional) The GCE disk type. Such as `"pd-ssd"`, `"local-ssd"`,
    `"pd-balanced"` or `"pd-standard"`.

* `disk_size_gb` - (Optional) The size of the image in gigabytes. If not
    specified, it will inherit the size of its base image. For SCRATCH disks,
    the size must be exactly 375GB.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of ket/value label pairs to assign to disk created from
    this template

* `type` - (Optional) The type of GCE disk, can be either `"SCRATCH"` or
    `"PERSISTENT"`.

* `disk_encryption_key` - (Optional) Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.

    If you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk using the customer-supplied encryption key.

    If you encrypt a disk using a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance.

    If you do not provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

    Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt disks in a managed instance group. Structure [documented below](#nested_access_config).

* `resource_policies` (Optional) -- A list (short name or id) of resource policies to attach to this disk for automatic snapshot creations. Currently a max of 1 resource policy is supported.

    Structure is documented below.

The `specific_reservation` block supports:

* `key` - (Required) Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource. To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, specify compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name as the key and specify the name of your reservation as the only value.

* `values` - (Required) Corresponds to the label values of a reservation resource.

<a name="nested_shielded_instance_config"></a>The `shielded_instance_config` block supports:

* `enable_secure_boot` (Optional) -- Verify the digital signature of all boot components, and halt the boot process if signature verification fails. Defaults to false.

* `enable_vtpm` (Optional) -- Use a virtualized trusted platform module, which is a specialized computer chip you can use to encrypt objects like keys and certificates. Defaults to true.

* `enable_integrity_monitoring` (Optional) -- Compare the most recent boot measurements to the integrity policy baseline and return a pair of pass/fail results depending on whether they match or not. Defaults to true.

<a name="nested_confidential_instance_config"></a>The `confidential_instance_config` block supports:

* `enable_confidential_compute` (Optional) Defines whether the instance should have confidential compute enabled. [`on_host_maintenance`](#on_host_maintenance) has to be set to TERMINATE or this will fail to create the VM.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/global/instanceTemplates/{{name}}`

* `metadata_fingerprint` - The unique fingerprint of the metadata.

* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.

* `self_link_unique` - A special URI of the created resource that uniquely identifies this instance template with the following format: `projects/{{project}}/global/instanceTemplates/{{name}}?uniqueId={{uniqueId}}`
Referencing an instance template via this attribute prevents Time of Check to Time of Use attacks when the instance template resides in a shared/untrusted environment.

* `tags_fingerprint` - The unique fingerprint of the tags.
