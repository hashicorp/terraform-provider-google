A Managed Lustre instance


To get more information about Instance, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/create-instance)

## Example Usage - Lustre Instance Basic


```hcl
resource "google_lustre_instance" "instance" {
  instance_id  = "my-instance"
  location     = "us-central1-a"
  description  = "test lustre instance"
  filesystem   = "testfs"
  capacity_gib = 18000
  network      = data.google_compute_network.lustre-network.id
  labels       = {
    test = "value"
  }
  timeouts {
		create = "120m"
	}
}

// This example assumes this network already exists.
// The API creates a tenant network per network authorized for a
// Lustre instance and that network is not deleted when the user-created
// network (authorized_network) is deleted, so this prevents issues
// with tenant network quota.
// If this network hasn't been created and you are using this example in your
// config, add an additional network resource or change
// this from "data"to "resource"
data "google_compute_network" "lustre-network" {
  name = "my-network"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `capacity_gib` -
  (Required)
  Required. The storage capacity of the instance in gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values
  are from 18000 to 954000, in increments of 9000.

* `filesystem` -

  tools, including when mounting the instance. Must be 8 characters or less
  and may only contain letters and numbers.

* `network` -
  (Required)
  Required. Immutable. The full name of the VPC network to which the instance is connected.
  Must be in the format
  `projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}`.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  Resource ID segment making up resource `name`. It identifies the resource within its parent collection as described in https://google.aip.dev/122.

* `instance_id` -
  (Required)
  Required. The name of the Managed Lustre instance.
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

  Possible values:
  STATE_UNSPECIFIED
  ACTIVE
  CREATING
  DELETING

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

## Import


Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Instance using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}"
  to = google_lustre_instance.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
