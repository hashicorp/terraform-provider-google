A Managed Lustre instance


To get more information about Instance, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/create-instance)

## Example Usage - Lustre Instance Basic


```hcl
resource "google_lustre_instance" "instance" {
  instance_id                 = "my-instance"
  location                    = "us-central1-a"
  description                 = "test lustre instance"
  filesystem                  = "testfs"
  capacity_gib                = 18000
  network                     = data.google_compute_network.lustre-network.id
  per_unit_storage_throughput = 1000
  labels                      = {
    test = "value"
  }
  timeouts {
		create = "120m"
	}
}

// This example assumes this network already exists.
// The API creates a tenant network per network authorized for a
// Lustre instance and that network is not deleted when the user-created
// network (authorized_network) is deleted, so this prevents issues
// with tenant network quota.
// If this network hasn't been created and you are using this example in your
// config, add an additional network resource or change
// this from "data"to "resource"
data "google_compute_network" "lustre-network" {
  name = "my-network"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `capacity_gib` -
  (Required)
  The storage capacity of the instance in gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values
  are from `18000` to `954000`, in increments of 9000.

* `filesystem` -
  (Required)
  The filesystem name for this instance. This name is used by client-side
  tools, including when mounting the instance. Must be eight characters or
  less and can only contain letters and numbers.

* `network` -
  (Required)
  The full name of the VPC network to which the instance is connected.
  Must be in the format
  `projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}`.

* `per_unit_storage_throughput` -
  (Required)
  The throughput of the instance in MB/s/TiB.
  Valid values are 125, 250, 500, 1000.

* `location` -
  (Required)
  Resource ID segment making up resource `name`. It identifies the resource within its parent collection as described in https://google.aip.dev/122.

* `instance_id` -
  (Required)
  The name of the Managed Lustre instance.
  * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  * Must start with a letter.
  * Must be between 1-63 characters.
  * Must end with a number or a letter.


* `gke_support_enabled` -

  GKE clients are not supported.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  A user-readable description of the instance.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels as key value pairs.
  **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
  Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource.

* `placement_policy` -
  (Optional)
  The placement policy name for the instance in the format of
  projects/{project}/locations/{location}/resourcePolicies/{resource_policy}

* `kms_key` -
  (Optional)
  The KMS key id to use for encryption of the Lustre instance.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.



## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`

* `update_time` -
  Timestamp when the instance was last updated.

* `state` -
  The state of the instance.
  Please see https://cloud.google.com/managed-lustre/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances#state for values

* `mount_point` -
  Mount point of the instance in the format `IP_ADDRESS@tcp:/FILESYSTEM`.

* `create_time` -
  Timestamp when the instance was created.

* `name` -
  Identifier. The name of the instance.

* `state_reason` -
  The reason why the instance is in a certain state.

* `terraform_labels` -

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 40 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 20 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 20 minutes.

## Import


Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}`
* `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`
* `{{location}}/{{instance_id}}`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, use an [`identity` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/identities) to import Instance using identity values. For example:

```tf
import {
  identity = {
    location = "<-required value->"
    instanceId = "<-required value->"
    project = "<-optional value->"
  }
  to = google_lustre_instance.default
}
```

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Instance using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}"
  to = google_lustre_instance.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Instance can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_id}}
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_id}}
$ terraform import google_lustre_instance.default {{location}}/{{instance_id}}
```

## User Project Overrides

This resource supports [User Project Overrides](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#user_project_override).
