* How-to Guides
    * [Creating a developer](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/adding-developers-your-api-product)

## Example Usage - Apigee Developer Basic


```hcl
data "google_client_config" "current" {}

resource "google_compute_network" "apigee_network" {
  name = "apigee-network"
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "apigee_range" {
  name          = "apigee-range"
  purpose       = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type  = "INTERNAL"
  prefix_length = 16
  network       = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "apigee_vpc_connection" {
  network                 = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.apigee_range.name]
}

resource "google_apigee_organization" "apigee_org" {
  analytics_region   = "us-central1"
  project_id         = data.google_client_config.current.project
  authorized_network = google_compute_network.apigee_network.id
  depends_on         = [google_service_networking_connection.apigee_vpc_connection]
}

resource "google_apigee_instance" "apigee_instance" {
  name               = "my-instance"
  location           = "us-central1"
  org_id             = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.id
  peering_cidr_range = "SLASH_22"
}

resource "google_apigee_developer" "apigee_developer" {
  email        = "john.doe@acme.com"
  first_name   = "John"
  last_name    = "Doe"
  user_name    = "john.doe"
  org_id       = google_apigee_organization.apigee_org.id
  depends_on = [
    google_apigee_instance.apigee_instance
  ]
}
```
## Example Usage - Apigee Developer With Attributes


```hcl

## Import


Developer can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

* `{{org_id}}/developers/{{email}}`
* `{{org_id}}/{{email}}`


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Developer using one of the formats above. For example:

```tf
import {
  id = "{{org_id}}/developers/{{email}}"
  to = google_apigee_developer.default
}
```

When using the [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import), Developer can be imported using one of the formats above. For example:

```
$ terraform import google_apigee_developer.default {{org_id}}/developers/{{email}}
$ terraform import google_apigee_developer.default {{org_id}}/{{email}}
```
