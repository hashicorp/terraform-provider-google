A ForwardingRule resource. A ForwardingRule resource specifies which pool
of target virtual machines to forward a packet to if it matches the given
[IPAddress, IPProtocol, portRange] tuple.

## Example Usage - Forwarding Rule Internallb


```hcl
// Forwarding rule for Internal Load Balancing
resource "google_compute_forwarding_rule" "default" {
  name   = "website-forwarding-rule"
  region = "us-central1"

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
  created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
  RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
  the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
  first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
  characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
  you create the resource.

* `ip_address` -
  (Optional)
  The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.
  Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
  scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).
  When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
  rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
  rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
  rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
  scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
  rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
  or IPv6.
  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
  1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
  forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
  internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range
  of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
  An address must be specified by a literal IP address. ~> **NOTE**: While
  the API allows you to specify various resource paths for an address resource
  instead, Terraform requires this to specifically be an IP address to
  avoid needing to fetching the IP address from resource paths on refresh
  or unnecessary diffs.

* `ip_protocol` -
  (Optional)
  The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP,
  UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.
  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
  valid.

* `backend_service` -
  (Optional)
  A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only
  for INTERNAL load balancing.

* `load_balancing_scheme` -
  (Optional)
  This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
  EXTERNAL, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
  Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
  and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
  INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
  and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
  INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.

* `network` -
  (Optional)
  For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
  the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
  this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.

* `port_range` -
  (Optional)
  This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
  TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
  TargetPool, TargetInstance.
  Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
  addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
  Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
  disjoint port ranges.
  Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
  ports:
  * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
  * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
  * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                    1883, 5222
  * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                    1883, 5222
  * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500

* `ports` -
  (Optional)
  This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal
  load balancing.
  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a comma
  separated list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed to
  these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
  forwarding rule.
  You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.

* `subnetwork` -
  (Optional)
  The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this
  Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
  If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
  optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
  subnetwork must be specified.

* `target` -
  (Optional)
  This field is only used for EXTERNAL load balancing.
  A reference to a TargetPool resource to receive the matched traffic.
  This target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
  The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target
  object.

* `all_ports` -
  (Optional)
  For internal TCP/UDP load balancing (i.e. load balancing scheme is
  INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP), set this to true to allow packets
  addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
  with this forwarding rule. Used with backend service. Cannot be set
  if port or portRange are set.

* `network_tier` -
  (Optional)
  The networking tier used for configuring this address. This field can
  take the following values: PREMIUM or STANDARD. If this field is not
  specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.

* `service_label` -
  (Optional)
  An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
  If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
  name.
  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
  Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
  regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
  character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
  must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
  character, which cannot be a dash.
  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
  This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `service_name` -
  The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

ForwardingRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_forwarding_rule.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_forwarding_rule.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_forwarding_rule.default {{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_forwarding_rule.default {{name}}
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
