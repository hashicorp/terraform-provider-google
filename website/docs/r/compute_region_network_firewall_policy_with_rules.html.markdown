## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  User-provided name of the Network firewall policy.
  The name should be unique in the project in which the firewall policy is created.
  The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically,
  the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?
  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
  lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

* `rule` -

  A list of firewall policy rules.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rule).


* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `policy_type` -
  (Optional)
  Policy type is used to determine which resources (networks) the policy can be associated with.
  A policy can be associated with a network only if the network has the matching policyType in its network profile.
  Different policy types may support some of the Firewall Rules features.
  Possible values are: `VPC_POLICY`, `RDMA_ROCE_POLICY`.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The region of this resource.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

  (Optional)
  A description of the rule.

* `rule_name` -
  (Optional)
  An optional name for the rule. This field is not a unique identifier
  and can be updated.

* `priority` -
  (Required)
  An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a value
  between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the
  highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.

* `match` -
  (Required)

  <code>targetSecureTag</code> are specified, the firewall rule applies
  to all instances on the specified network.
  Maximum number of target label tags allowed is 256.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rule_target_secure_tag).

  It can be set only if action = 'apply_security_profile_group' and cannot be set for other actions.

* `disabled` -
  (Optional)
  Denotes whether the firewall policy rule is disabled. When set to true,
  the firewall policy rule is not enforced and traffic behaves as if it did
  not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall policy rule will be
  enabled.
