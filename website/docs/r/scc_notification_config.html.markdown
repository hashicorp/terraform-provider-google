# google\_scc\_notification\_config

A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) notification configs. A
notification config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
configuration to send notifications for create/update events of
findings, assets and etc.
~> **Note:** In order to use Cloud SCC resources, your organization must be enrolled 
in [SCC Standard/Premium](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/quickstart-security-command-center).
Without doing so, you may run into errors during resource creation.

  organization = "123456789"
  description  = "My custom Cloud Security Command Center Finding Notification Configuration"
  pubsub_topic =  google_pubsub_topic.scc_notification.id

  streaming_config {
    filter = "category = \"OPEN_FIREWALL\" AND state = \"ACTIVE\""
  }
}
```
