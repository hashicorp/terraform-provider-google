# google\_bigquery\_dataset\_access

Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
`google_bigquery_dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.

~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, the
dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
`ignore_changes = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.


To get more information about DatasetAccess, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets)
* How-to Guides
    * [Controlling access to datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-access-controls)

~> **Warning:** You must specify the role field using the legacy format `OWNER` instead of `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`. 
The API does accept both formats but it will always return the legacy format which results in Terraform
showing permanent diff on each plan and apply operation.

## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Access Basic User


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "access" {
  dataset_id    = google_bigquery_dataset.dataset.dataset_id
  role          = "OWNER"
  user_by_email = google_service_account.bqowner.email
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
  dataset_id = "example_dataset"
}

resource "google_service_account" "bqowner" {
  account_id = "bqowner"
}
```
## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Access View


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "access" {
  dataset_id    = google_bigquery_dataset.private.dataset_id
  view {
    project_id = google_bigquery_table.public.project
    dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.public.dataset_id
    table_id   = google_bigquery_table.public.table_id
  }
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "private" {
  dataset_id = "example_dataset"
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "public" {
  dataset_id = "example_dataset2"
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "public" {
  deletion_protection = false
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.public.dataset_id
  table_id   = "example_table"

  view {
    query          = "SELECT state FROM [lookerdata:cdc.project_tycho_reports]"
    use_legacy_sql = false
  }
}
```
## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Access Authorized Dataset


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "access" {
  dataset_id    = google_bigquery_dataset.private.dataset_id
  dataset {
    dataset{
      project_id = google_bigquery_dataset.public.project
      dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.public.dataset_id
    }
    target_types = ["VIEWS"]
  }
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "private" {
  dataset_id = "private"
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "public" {
  dataset_id = "public"
}
```
## Example Usage - Bigquery Dataset Access Authorized Routine


```hcl
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "public" {
  dataset_id  = "public_dataset"
  description = "This dataset is public"
}

resource "google_bigquery_routine" "public" {
  dataset_id      = google_bigquery_dataset.public.dataset_id
  routine_id      = "public_routine"
  routine_type    = "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION"
  language        = "SQL"
  definition_body = <<-EOS
    SELECT 1 + value AS value
  EOS
  arguments {
    name          = "value"
    argument_kind = "FIXED_TYPE"
    data_type     = jsonencode({ "typeKind" = "INT64" })
  }
  return_table_type = jsonencode({ "columns" = [
    { "name" = "value", "type" = { "typeKind" = "INT64" } },
  ] })
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "private" {
  dataset_id  = "private_dataset"
  description = "This dataset is private"
}

resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "authorized_routine" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.private.dataset_id
  routine {
    project_id = google_bigquery_routine.public.project
    dataset_id = google_bigquery_routine.public.dataset_id
    routine_id = google_bigquery_routine.public.routine_id
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `dataset_id` -
  (Required)
  A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID
  must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or
  underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.


- - -


* `role` -
  (Optional)
  Describes the rights granted to the user specified by the other
  member of the access object. Basic, predefined, and custom roles are
  supported. Predefined roles that have equivalent basic roles are
  swapped by the API to their basic counterparts, and will show a diff
  post-create. See
  [official docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).

* `user_by_email` -
  (Optional)
  An email address of a user to grant access to. For example:
  fred@example.com

* `group_by_email` -
  (Optional)
  An email address of a Google Group to grant access to.

* `domain` -
  (Optional)
  A domain to grant access to. Any users signed in with the
  domain specified will be granted the specified access

* `special_group` -
  (Optional)
  A special group to grant access to. Possible values include:

  * `projectOwners`: Owners of the enclosing project.

  * `projectReaders`: Readers of the enclosing project.

  * `projectWriters`: Writers of the enclosing project.

  * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: All authenticated BigQuery users.

* `iam_member` -
  (Optional)
  Some other type of member that appears in the IAM Policy but isn't a user,
  group, domain, or special group. For example: `allUsers`

* `view` -
  (Optional)
  A view from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
  executed against that view will have read access to tables in
  this dataset. The role field is not required when this field is
  set. If that view is updated by any user, access to the view
  needs to be granted again via an update operation.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_view).

* `dataset` -
  (Optional)
  Grants all resources of particular types in a particular dataset read access to the current dataset.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_dataset).

* `routine` -
  (Optional)
  A routine from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
  executed against that routine will have read access to tables in
  this dataset. The role field is not required when this field is
  set. If that routine is updated by any user, access to the routine
  needs to be granted again via an update operation.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_routine).

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
