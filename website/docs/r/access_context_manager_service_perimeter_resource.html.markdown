# google\_access\_context\_manager\_service\_perimeter\_resource

Allows configuring a single GCP resource that should be inside of a service perimeter.
This resource is intended to be used in cases where it is not possible to compile a full list
of projects to include in a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
to enable them to be added separately.

~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
the service perimeter resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [status[0].resources]` so
they don't fight over which resources should be in the policy.


To get more information about ServicePerimeterResource, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/accessPolicies.servicePerimeters)
* How-to Guides
    * [Service Perimeter Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/quickstart)

## Example Usage - Access Context Manager Service Perimeter Resource Basic


```hcl
resource "google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter_resource" "service-perimeter-resource" {
  perimeter_name = google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter.service-perimeter-resource.name
  resource = "projects/987654321"
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter" "service-perimeter-resource" {
  parent = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}"
  name   = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.access-policy.name}/servicePerimeters/restrict_all"
  title  = "restrict_all"
  status {
    restricted_services = ["storage.googleapis.com"]
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [status[0].resources]
  }
}

resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "access-policy" {
  parent = "organizations/123456789"
