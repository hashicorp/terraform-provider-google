        For large Terraform configs, please use a service like Dropbox and share a link to the ZIP file. For security, you can also encrypt the files using our GPG public key: https://www.hashicorp.com/security

        If reproducing the bug involves modifying the config file (that is, apply a config, change a value, apply the config again, see the bug), then please include both:

        * the version of the config before the change, and
        * the version of the config after the change.
