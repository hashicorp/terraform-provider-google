# Contributing to Terraform - Google Provider

For a set of general guidelines, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page in the main Terraform repository.

The following are certain Google Provider-specific things to be aware of when contributing.

## Go

We aim to make the Google Provider a good steward of Go practices. See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments for common Go mistakes that you should attempt to avoid.

## Vendoring Libraries

When adding support for just-released GCP features, you'll often need to vendor a new version of the Google API client and
occasionally some of the downstream dependencies of that client. The Google Provider uses [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor)
in order to manage dependencies. To vendor a new package or update an existing package, run:

```bash
govendor fetch {{path}}
```

For example:

```bash
govendor fetch google.golang.org/api/compute/v1
```

When updating a vendored library, try to submit the vendoring as a separate pull request and include the commands you ran in
the pull request description.

## Tests

### Running Tests

The following environment variables must be set in order to run tests:
```
GOOGLE_PROJECT
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS or GOOGLE_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS
```
For certain tests, the following variables may also need to be set:
```
GOOGLE_REGION
GOOGLE_ORG
GOOGLE_BILLING_ACCOUNT
```

The only region we support running tests in right now is `us-central1` - some products that are tested here are only available in a few regions, and the only region that all products are available in is `us-central1`.

To run a specific test, use a command such as:
```
make testacc TEST=./google TESTARGS='-run=TestAccContainerNodePool_basic'
```

The `TESTARGS` variable is regexp-like, so multiple tests can be run in parallel by specifying a common substring of those tests (for example, `TestAccContainerNodePool` to run all node pool tests).

To run all tests, you can simply omit the `TESTARGS` argument - but please keep in mind that that is quite a few tests and will take quite a long time and create some fairly expensive resources.  It usually is not advisable to run all tests.

### Writing Tests

Tests should confirm that a resource can be created, and that the resulting Terraform state has the correct values, as well as the created GCP resource.

Tests should confirm that the resource works in a variety of scenarios, and not just that it can be created in a basic fashion.

Resources that support update should have tests for update.

Resources that are importable should have a test that confirms that every field is importable. This should be part of an existing test (in the regular resource_test.go file) as an extra TestStep with the following format:
```
resource.TestStep{
	ResourceName:      "google_compute_backend_service.foobar",
	ImportState:       true,
	ImportStateVerify: true,
},
```

## Running a local copy of the provider
If you are building Terraform from source with a Google provider built from source, Terraform will automatically use the 
local `terraform-provider-google` plugin in `$GOPATH/bin`.

In order to use a release copy of Terrafom with a local provider, you can use the [provider discovery directory](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery)
at `~/.terraform.d/plugins`. When a copy of the Google provider is present in the discovery directory, `terraform init` will
use that copy instead of downloading a release version.

To use a single locally built version, such as one built by a CI or build server, you can copy a `terraform-provider-google`
binary into the discovery directory. If you're testing a local provider in active development and want the new binary each
time you run `make build`, you can symlink the built binary into the directory:

```bash
ln -s $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-google ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-google
```

## Autogenerated Resources

Some resources in the Google provider are autogenerated using the [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules) framework, and have a large disclaimer as a comment at the top of their files to say so. For feature requests or bugs regarding those resources, please continue to file [issues](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues) here. PRs changing those resources will not be accepted.
