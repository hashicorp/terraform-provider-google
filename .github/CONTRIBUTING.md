# Contributing to Terraform - Google Provider

For a set of general guidelines, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page in the main Terraform repository.

The following are certain Google Provider-specific things to be aware of when contributing.

## Go

We aim to make the Google Provider a good steward of Go practices. See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments for common Go mistakes that you should attempt to avoid.

## Vendoring Libraries

When adding support for just-released GCP features, you'll often need to vendor a new version of the Google API client and
occasionally some of the downstream dependencies of that client. The Google Provider uses [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor)
in order to manage dependencies. To vendor a new package or update an existing package, run:

```bash
govendor fetch {{path}}
```

For example:

```bash
govendor fetch google.golang.org/api/compute/v1
```

When updating a vendored library, try to submit the vendoring as a separate pull request and include the commands you ran in
the pull request description.

## Tests

### Running Tests

The following environment variables must be set in order to run tests:
```
GOOGLE_PROJECT
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS or GOOGLE_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS
```
For certain tests, the following variables may also need to be set:
```
GOOGLE_REGION
GOOGLE_ORG
GOOGLE_BILLING_ACCOUNT
```

To run a specific test, use a command such as:
```
make testacc TEST=./google TESTARGS='-run=TestAccContainerNodePool_basic'
```

The `TESTARGS` variable is regexp-like, so multiple tests can be run in parallel by specifying a common substring of those tests (for example, `TestAccContainerNodePool` to run all node pool tests).

### Writing Tests

Tests should confirm that a resource can be created, and that the resulting Terraform state has the correct values, as well as the created GCP resource.

Tests should confirm that the resource works in a variety of scenarios, and not just that it can be created in a basic fashion.

Resources that support update should have tests for update.

Resources that are importable should have a test that confirms that every field is importable. This should be part of an existing test (in the regular resource_test.go file) as an extra TestStep with the following format:
```
resource.TestStep{
	ResourceName:      "google_compute_backend_service.foobar",
	ImportState:       true,
	ImportStateVerify: true,
},
```

## Autogenerated Resources

Some resources in the Google provider are autogenerated using the [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules) framework, and have a large disclaimer as a comment at the top of their files to say so. For feature requests or bugs regarding those resources, please continue to file [issues](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues) here. PRs changing those resources will not be accepted.
