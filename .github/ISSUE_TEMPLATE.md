Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Terraform issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general usage questions, please see: https://www.terraform.io/community.html.

If this is a bug report (for when something is there, but doesn't work how it should), please use the [bug issue template](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=bug.md) instead.

If this is an enhancement / feature request (for when something (a resource, field, etc.) is missing, and should be added), please use the [enhancement template](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=enhancement.md) instead.

If you have a support request or question, please check out the other resources listed [here](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/new?template=question.md).

If your issue does not fit into one of the above templates, please fill out the following:
