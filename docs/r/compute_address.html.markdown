# google\_compute\_address

Represents an Address resource.

Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
you must specify the instance's external IP address.

Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
static.


To get more information about Address, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/beta/addresses)
* How-to Guides
    * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network)
    * [Reserving a Static Internal IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_compute_address" "ip_address" {
  name = "my-address"
}
```
```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "default" {
  name = "my-network"
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "default" {
  name          = "my-subnet"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = "${google_compute_network.default.self_link}"
}

resource "google_compute_address" "internal_with_subnet_and_address" {
  name         = "my-internal-address"
  subnetwork   = "${google_compute_subnetwork.default.self_link}"
  address_type = "INTERNAL"
  address      = "10.0.42.42"
  region       = "us-central1"
}
```
```hcl
resource "google_compute_address" "static" {
  name = "ipv4-address"
}

data "google_compute_image" "debian_image" {
	family  = "debian-9"
	project = "debian-cloud"
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "instance_with_ip" {
	name         = "vm-instance"
	machine_type = "f1-micro"
	zone         = "us-central1-a"

	boot_disk {
		initialize_params{
			image = "${data.google_compute_image.debian_image.self_link}"
		}
	}

	network_interface {
		network = "default"
		access_config {
			nat_ip = "${google_compute_address.static.address}"
		}
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
  comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
  long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
  which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
  following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
  except the last character, which cannot be a dash.


- - -


* `address` -
  (Optional)
  The static external IP address represented by this resource. Only
  IPv4 is supported. An address may only be specified for INTERNAL
  address types. The IP address must be inside the specified subnetwork,
  if any.

* `address_type` -
  (Optional)
  The type of address to reserve, either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
  If unspecified, defaults to EXTERNAL.

* `description` -
  (Optional)
  An optional description of this resource.

* `network_tier` -
  (Optional)
  The networking tier used for configuring this address. This field can
  take the following values: PREMIUM or STANDARD. If this field is not
  specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.

* `subnetwork` -
  (Optional)
  The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If an IP
  address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP range.
  This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with
  GCE_ENDPOINT/DNS_RESOLVER purposes.

* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels to apply to this address.  A list of key->value pairs.  This property is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
  See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta fields.

* `region` -
  (Optional)
  The Region in which the created address should reside.
  If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:


* `creation_timestamp` -
  Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `users` -
  The URLs of the resources that are using this address.

* `label_fingerprint` -
  The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
  internally during updates.  This property is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
  See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta fields.
* `self_link` - The URI of the created resource.


* `address` - The IP of the created resource.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `update` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Address can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_compute_address.default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/addresses/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_address.default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
$ terraform import google_compute_address.default {{name}}
```
