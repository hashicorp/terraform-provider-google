				Description: `IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
to the referenced 'target' or 'backendService'.

While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is
required under the following circumstances:

* When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and
'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the
'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'.
* When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'.


Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
assigns an ephemeral IP address.

Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
forwarding rule:

* IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3'
* IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96'
* Full resource URL, as in
'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
* Partial URL or by name, as in:
  * 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
  * 'regions/region/addresses/address-name'
  * 'global/addresses/address-name'
  * 'address-name'


The forwarding rule's 'target' or 'backendService',
and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the
type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
[IP address
specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).

When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP
address number.`,
